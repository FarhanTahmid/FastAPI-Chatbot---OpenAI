28,000 signatures so far! 

16 years ago, I was robbed of clitoral sensation permanently due to OB/GYN ignorance of clitoral anatomy. The nerves in the clitoris still aren‚Äôt getting taught, putting other women at risk. Please help me change this so that other women are not harmed like I was.¬†

The nerves in the clitoris are 2-3 mm in diameter and travel superficially under the clitoral hood skin.

As such, they are vulnerable to injury and put at risk in a number of procedures OB/GYNs perform: biopsies, clitoral hood reductions, and repairs after childbirth, sexual assault, and straddle injuries. Understanding this anatomy is also important in diagnosing and managing female sexual dysfunction.¬†

Unfortunately, though the nerves in the clitoris were published in 1844 and many times since, they were omitted from OB/GYN literature until 2019. Though I‚Äôve gotten studies published and multiple textbooks updated with this anatomy, it‚Äôs still not getting taught to most OB/GYNs.¬†

The American College of OB/GYNs has the power to help dictate what gets taught. But they recently said, in an email, that the nerves in the clitoris ‚Äúdo not fit‚Äù in their recommended CREOG curriculum for OB/GYNs.¬†

If they would include it, this would help ensure OB/GYNs are being taught this anatomy, which is critical for female sexual function.¬†  


Personally, the nerves in my clitoris were injured in a clitoral hood reduction done without my consent during a labiaplasty. I lost clitoral sensation permanently. After my surgery, I was told by every OB/GYN I went to for help that my loss couldn‚Äôt have been caused by my surgery and was all in my head.¬†

16 years later, not one top 20 OB/GYN program will agree to teach this anatomy, despite being entreated to do so by me and my plastic surgeon father.¬†

There are many other women with stories like mine, who have lost clitoral function after biopsies, cosmetic surgeries, and repairs (including one after a rape). Preventable damage done during repairs likely goes unrecognized because women assume the original injury caused the damage, rather than their doctor.¬†  


My loss was so traumatic it felt sometimes worse than death. It is made more painful knowing my injury isn‚Äôt considered worth preventing. But it is worth preventing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/kf0d1g/please_sign_petition_to_get_nerves_in_the/,Please sign petition to get nerves in the clitoris included in ACOG‚Äôs curriculum.

1. Vaginal discharge is normal.

2. Wearing panty liners 24/7 is not necessary.

3. Vaginas are acidic enough to BLEACH fabric, hence the discoloration of underwear.

4. Longer labias are more normal than smaller ones (but both are fine).

5. A mans sperm CAN throw off your ph balance and also change the smell of your vagina

6. It is not safe for vaginas to smell like sunshine and flowers so quit expecting it to.

7. STOP douching and washing your vagina with bath&body works, and Victoria secret. Shits not healthy for the vagina.

8. The vagina cleans itself.

9. Having sex has no correlation of how ""tight"" your vagina is.

10. Yeast infections are COMMON!!!

11. The best thing you can do for your vagina is to leave it alone.üò¥

12. If your vagina stinks or your discharge stink and has a color than go see a gynecologist and stop trying to blame cause you stink.

13. Let it breathe.

14. The VAGINA is the narrow canal that runs INSIDE the body. NOT the whole genital area.  
\*Do not use soap in your vagina.\*

15. Always urinate after sex to rinse the urinary tract of fluids that could be caught there and can cause UTIs.

16. Drink water.

17. COTTON panties ladies. Wearing silk, satin and lace seven days a week will abso-fucking-lutely throw your Ph off.

Don't argue with me about this. I don't give a fuck if you say your mama put you in satin diapers and all you've ever worn is satin panties. If that's true, YOUR SHIT IS OFF.  I GUARANTEE it.

18. Stop sprinkling powder on your lady bits, stop IMMEDIATELY! Talcum causes cancer. This isn't a hoax or a joke and I don't care if your 97 year old great Aunt Myrtle has been using it twice a day, everyday. STOP IT! TODAY!

19. Also the Vagina is a natural sperm killer, except when you‚Äôre ovulating with the exception of a very high ph level.

20. This is all correct and true. Stop letting men who think washing their ass and moisturizing is gay try and tell you how to care for your ladybits. Ladies, stop letting boys who got sex ed from Pornhub tell you about YOUR vagina.

16mput6,WomensHealth,1695127073.0,"So I am 40 I decided I was done having kids and wanted to go back on BC. 

I went to the gynaecologist here in Greece where I live now. I was dreading it because all my experiences with the GYNO in America have been shoving fingers uncomfortably into you and pressing just uncomfortable. 

My exam in Greece was done w a very slender ultrasound wand. No pain. No Rando up in my business. 

We then discussed Birth control. Here you get blood work first and then they prescribe a Birth control pill that pairs with your blood work results. - literally never in America 

Then he told me that after 40 they are hesitant to prescribe the pill because that can increase breast cancer and before 40 the pill can cause blood clots which is why they make all women regardless of age do blood work before they prescribe BC pills (which is free here BTW) - did NOT know any of this. 

He then suggested an IUD. The Mirena which I heard was super painful to insert. 

Here in Greece they insert it at a hospital with General anesthesia because it hurts so bad. It takes an HR and is an in and out patient procedure simple stream lined no pain. 

He then told me that they are NOT ever supposed to insert it in the office unless the women has had a vaginal birth and even then it would probably hurt. They can however remove it in the office. 

In America they make women suffer regardless of how the Mierna IUD guidelines because they are too cheap to care about us.

 The US health care is complete and utter garbage. 

I actually have health care here because I‚Äôm working so I pay into the Greek tax payers system. Which just mean prescriptions are free and any public hospital is free. 

A dr visit here is about 40-50 euros which is the same as my coepay was in America 5 years ago when I left.

i48i58,Periods,1596644888.0,"Last year I was diagnosed with uterine cancer at the age of 38. I underwent months of treatment, including a radical hysterectomy, chemotherapy, and targeted radiation. Thankfully I'm currently NED (no evidence of disease) and I'm hopeful that it won't return. This is the story of how I found out I had cancer, my hope is that by sharing it maybe it will encourage others to go to the doctor and get screened before it's too late. ***Fair warning some of this is a little graphic.***

It started about six to eight months before my diagnosis. It happened gradually. My periods started getting heavier and longer. At first I blamed it on stress and weight fluctuations. I was under a ton of stress at work and actually ended up quitting my job (after being there almost a decade). I had also recently lost 70 pounds and regained 30 of it. Surely this must be the reason for my crazy periods, right? (Edit to add: my periods were often irregular so that's another reason I didn't take it seriously at first.)  

Eventually it got to the point where my periods just didn't stop. Yet I put off going to the doctor and continued to make rationalizations. It's important to note that the heavy, out-of-the-ordinary bleeding was the *only* symptom I had. I was not in pain, had no cramps, nothing else odd or worrying. I learned later that this is not unusual. Heavier/longer periods is often the only warning sign most uterine/ovarian cancer patients get, it also happens in about 90% of endometrial cancer cases. I wish I had known that.  

Then it happened. The day came when I couldn't ignore it anymore. I was at my new job going about my day when I suddenly had what can only be described as a contraction. (I've never been pregnant or given birth, so it was like nothing I've ever felt before.) Instinctively I knew what was about to happen and ran to the bathroom. I spent the next hour hemorrhaging blood and endometrial tissue. It was traumatic and disgusting.   

I had a friend drive me to the emergency room. I had lost so much blood that I ultimately ended up needing five blood transfusions. At first the doctor thought I might be having a miscarriage, but I definitely wasn't pregnant. So they did a pelvic exam and an ultrasound. Immediately I was rushed into surgery to stop the bleeding and scrape out my uterus (common procedure called a D&C). I don't remember a lot of the details of that night, but I certainly remember my surgeon coming to speak to me afterward. She said she didn't have to wait for the pathology results to know I had cancer and that she was referring me to an oncologist for further treatment and a hysterectomy. Up until that point it had never occurred to me that it could be cancer. Somehow I'd completely blocked out that possibility - considered every other option but that. Denial is a powerful thing.   

So, if you have increasingly heavier or longer than normal periods (or bleeding after menopause) does that mean you have cancer? No, not necessarily. Other things can cause it. But it does mean you NEED to get *thoroughly* checked out by a doctor. Ask for a CA-125 blood test, ultrasound, and/or biopsy to screen for cancer (and if they refuse say you want their refusal documented in your chart and that you want a copy). Some doctors might just try to give you birth control pills and send you on your way, don't let them. Be your own advocate. If they say you're ""too young"" to have cancer that's a red flag, my cancer support group is full of 20 and 30 year olds who were told this. Sadly some were not taken seriously until it was too late. It is also important to note that a pap smear only checks for cervical cancer, not uterine or ovarian cancer. So listen to your body and if something is out of the ordinary get checked out.  

TL;DR increasingly heavy/irregular/longer than normal periods are often the *only* warning sign of uterine or ovarian cancer.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Periods/comments/i48i58/how_i_found_out_i_had_uterine_cancer_and_what/,How I found out I had uterine cancer and what every woman should know about her period...,Health,775,62,1.0,digitalvagrant

We were talking about how irritating it is society deems vaginal tightness as a goal, and how we'd give anything to be looser. After we said this, a friend got emotional and told us how she thought she was the only one with Vaginismus because its not openly spoken about. This friend is in her 30s guys.
 Imagine carrying that around with you for all those years, the shame, the guilt, the anger. 

And then it got us all thinking, why is none of this ever spoken about? Sex Ed at school? If you're lucky to get any in the first place, all you're taught is how pregnancy happens, a bit about STIs and birth control. That's all. Why aren't we talking about COMMON issues? No ones being taught about:
 Painful Sex,
Vaginal Dryness,
Discharge,
 Thrush, 
Bacterial Vaginosis,
Menstruation and what the different shades of blood are, or clots. 
The Vagina is self cleaning, so only clean the vulva.

Can you imagine how many young vagina- owners there are going round thinking they're not normal, when in reality, they're pretty normal.

15ak0u8,Healthyhooha,1690410755.0,"For just about as long as I‚Äôve been sexually active (about 10 years) I‚Äôve experienced this painful papercut-like tear everytime I‚Äôve had penetrative sex of any kind.

It would happen right at the base of the vaginal opening (perineal area) leading to a stinging burning sensation that would bleed just a litttttlleeeeee bit. Obviously super uncomfortable and distracting. 

It didn‚Äôt really occur to me that this shouldn‚Äôt really be happening, I just figured it was normal for the longest time. 

When I told my current partner of 7 years she felt so bad because she had no idea that it was happening and felt horrible. That was probably like 2-3 years ago. So we‚Äôd try different positions, lubes, toys, fingers, take even longer for foreplay, etc. nothing helped. To be clear too, it‚Äôs not the actual deep penetration that hurts, it‚Äôs just at the entrance.

After about a year of trying different things I finally canned up and talked to a doctor. I explicitly mentioned to her that arousal and lubrication was not an issue. I told her that I did not need any information on these but needed information on anything else that could be causing that. She sounded like she was listening, but after my appointment she wrote me a prescription for birth control and sent me lists of lubes to use and podcasts on arousal. 

I was so upset y‚Äôall, I cried. And then I had to pay the $80 copay. It was so frustrating.

I ended up taking a few more months to reach out to another doctor and put my foot down. I asked the nurse to order me a full STI, BV, UTI, and yeast panel. I went in last week and had all the tests done. This doctor was a lot more patient and took a solid 30 minutes with me instead of the last doctor. 

She mentioned it possibly being HPV a first guess, but otherwise ‚Äúchronic inflammation and irritation.‚Äù She asked if I wear tight clothes/thongs often. I don‚Äôt really wear tight clothes but I do wear thongs daily unless I‚Äôm on my period. She suggested I switch to something more comfortable and go commando when possible. 

A few days later all tests came back negative but I kept up with her other suggestions.

Y‚Äôall. I waited like 4 days and my partner and I had sex after making these changes and almost all the pain was gone. It was so nice to have sex without the pain again. I used to tense up so much, worried, and I could never relax.

I‚Äôm so happy I found a solution, but frustrated it took me this long. I was browsing other subreddits with other people posting this issue with no resolution, so I wanted to also post in case anyone else had this issue.

1745f0w,Healthyhooha,1696891580.0,"Why do so many shows and comedians make jokes about smelly vaginas? Who are these jokes for, just men, or do women also think they're funny? I feel like they're punching down, and they're unfair since only about 50% of the world is affected. And no woman can actually stand up against the jokes because people will just say, why are you offended, does your vagina smell?

I keep starting new tv shows thinking the topic won't come up but it so often does! Unless I watch a kid friendly comedy series, it's always just a matter of time before someone makes a joke about vaginas. Is it because we think women with them are unhygienic, or too sexual, and therefore merit the joke as punishment? The jokes just feel really shitty because it's very out of your control. So many women get recurring bv and it's not necessarily even due to sexual reasons - they can be caused by antibiotics taken for other reasons. Mine started in childhood, I'm guessing it was due to antibiotics or something else out of my control! But even if it's caused by sex, it's not a women's fault if they try treatment but end up with recurring BV. Recurring BV is not well understand by science and that's no one's fault.

I'm just so sick of being the butt of jokes that cause a lot of shame. And watching TV shows that are fun for everyone else unaffected.

14bfkre,Healthyhooha,1686970742.0,"First Reddit post in a while and like my third ever. Seeking help as it‚Äôs late at night during a weekend and can‚Äôt see a doctor til Monday most likely. Sorry if this is TMI. PICS ATTACHED. 

I was using the bathroom and when I wiped, I saw a black dot on the paper. Found it weird, wiped again and there‚Äôs was another. I then reach down there and touch with my hand and find even more! I quickly wash myself with water from the sink til there‚Äôs no more. 

But something told me ‚Äúcheck inside‚Äù. So I digged inside (after washing my hands) and THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE. It was mixed with white, odorless discharge (as pictured in comments). This is where I really start freaking out because WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?! And when I squished them with my fingers, there was like a black powder or paste that came out of them (as pictured in comments). 

Like I said, I definitely plan to go to the OBGYN on Monday but I wanted to see if anyone else has experienced or even heard of this before because no one I know has and I‚Äôm freaking out !!!

Thanks in advance.


UPDATE: Hello everyone. I‚Äôm super late (sorry!) but here‚Äôs my update.

1) I definitely wasn‚Äôt trolling!! Didn‚Äôt even know that was a thing on here, especially on the type of communities I posted on (women‚Äôs health). I really was just freaking out on a random night where I couldn‚Äôt see my Obgyn for a few days and ran to the internet for advice. 

2) Since I‚Äôm not an avid Reddit user, seeing all the comments I got (some negative, some positive) gave me SO much anxiety and I just deleted the app lol. I just signed back into my account recently and remembered this so thought I‚Äôd update!

3) Here‚Äôs the story: I did go to the emergency room even though I was hesitant just because I wanted whatever was in there to still have some trace that it was in there and waiting til Monday wasn‚Äôt going to guarantee that. 

IT ENDED UP BEING BORIC ACID. A couple days prior to this, I had sex and afterwards smelled a light smell so I decided to pop in a boric acid suppository overnight. For those that don‚Äôt know, the suppository just dissolves on its own and you don‚Äôt think about it again. Turns out that this suppository just .. didn‚Äôt dissolve completely? It just stayed there for a couple days and since the vagina is self-cleaning, it started pushing out the contents and that‚Äôs when I first saw it when wiping. No one in the ER could tell me why they turned black but they reassured me I wasn‚Äôt dying and that I was going to be okay so I was good with that!! Scary and embarrassing experience but I am glad I went and got it checked out sooner rather than later. 

Also just wanna say thanks to everyone who was nice, caring, and helpful. For the one who doubted that it was real: I get it.

I am a 23 year old female who has been suffering from an itchy vulva/butt for five and a half months. I‚Äôve seen many suffer with that on this reddit so I wanna share my story and hopefully help in some way. 
I‚Äôve always suffered with intermittent vulva itching but if I‚Äôm being honest, I kinda ignored it but last October it got really bad. I went to planned parenthood and they said I had a yeast infection, did an STD test and sent me on my way with antibiotics. The itching didnt go away. I returned to planned parenthood two more times, they gave me a steroid cream that did not help and continuously treated me for a yeast infection I did not have and did repetive STD tests. Eventually, they pretty much said they couldnt do anything. I then went to a gynochologist who gave me ANOTHER steroid, also tested me for STD‚Äôs and gave me more yeast pills. After two months of suffering I was over it and decided to go to a dermatologist. The first dermatologist was horribly rude, looked at me for literally 10 seconds and said it looked fine but gave me a steroid cream anyways. This cream gave me a terrible rash. I went to a second dermatologist who was male and clearly uncomfortable looking at my genitals. He looked at me for about 2 seconds and gave me an antifungal cream and more yeast pills lol. I was at my wits end. I could barely do anything, I couldnt work out so I was gaining weight, I couldnt have sex, and showering made things horribly worse. I finally decided to go to a third dermatologist who honestly saved me. She was the first dermatologist to use a dermascope on my vulva (the microscope that derms use), and also checked my butt, elbows, head and fingers with it. She looked at me and said ‚ÄúYou so clearly have psoriosis on multiple parts of your body including your genitals. I am shocked nobody noticed this, I wish you had seen me 5 months ago‚Äù. I honestly burst into tears because it was so nice having someone actually take me seriously and not automatically assume I have a yeast infection or an STD. I explained psorious and autoimmune diseases run in my family and she figured out that one of my psychiatric medications can trigger psoriosis. She gave me a topical psoriosis cream and has told me to supplement with Vitamin D. I have already started to feel better and its only been a week. While ‚Äúcured‚Äù isnt the right word for my issues because psoriosis is a long term condition, it can get better with certain medications and lifestyle changes. All I have to say is, please please please advocate for yourself. I let the doctors walk all over me for 5 months even though I knew there was something off. I hope this can help in anyway or at least give you hope that it is possible to get better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/mo47qq/found_a_cure_for_my_itchy_vulva/,Found a cure for my itchy vulva!!, Community Updates,579,58,1.0,ps3226
rxdnqm,Healthyhooha,1641472777.0,"Why the fuck do people become gynecologists if they're gonna judge you for seeking treatment? Some of these doctors are borderline incompetent too, it's infuriating. (Context: I live in a very conservative country.)

So I (21F) have had issues with my thyroid for  almost three years now and I was unmedicated for a good chunk of that time which took a huge toll on my body. 

I guess because my hormones are all out of whack, I've been chronically dry down there with low libido and diminished physical sensation, and my bartholin's glands have been partially blocked for over a year because the fluid is too viscous.

Not exactly A-OK. So I visit a gynecologist. Did she prescribe medication or order further blood tests? Nope. 

She asked me ""why do you care so much about being dry if you're unmarried?"" Apparently it's not a problem worth treating if I'm not actively in pain, because I'm an unmarried woman. My body is not functioning as it should and I want it fixed, is that not a good enough reason? 

Awkward moment aside she decides to do a physical examination anyway. Apparently there's ""absolutely nothing wrong with me"" and ""how would you (21F, unmarried) even *know* you're too dry?"" Because only married people get wet and experience sexual arousal, apparently. Unmarried women are just oblivious to their vagina's existence until marriage, don't you know? 

I'm not having any of this, so I explain that I've previously had a blocked (painless) bartholin's gland which I developed after my thyroid issues started, hoping that might elicit some helpful advice. She told me it's because I have pubic hair which must mean I'm unhygienic. That's about when I gave up.

I'm not even surprised. This isn't even uncommon behavior among gynecologists here. I'm sick of begging doctors to do their job.

I put a finger in my vagina and felt a weird lump on the side of my wall with the hair attached to it and had the horrible realization that it was somehow tangled up in there. Boyfriend felt around and agreed it felt concerning. I called the on call number for my gyn and they said I wouldn‚Äôt be able to be seen until Tuesday, otherwise I‚Äôd have to go to the ED. 

I went this morning and after a 5 hr wait, had a young male resident have a look and said it was wrapped around a piece of my vaginal tissue and cutting off the circulation. I should also mention that I work at this hospital so it‚Äôs especially mortifying that I had to go in for this. He looked at his attending and said there was no way he could get it but that the tissue was dark from circulation being cut off so they called OB. At this point I‚Äôm crying and freaking out.
OB came and they were super nice and felt confident they would get it out. After laying there with scissors and forceps in my vagina while hyperventilating and crying, the hair was unwound and removed. My guess is that the hair got in there when my boyfriend and I were having sex over the weekend and the in-out somehow wound it up in there. 

Truly crazy. The OB attending was an old guy who ‚Äúthinks‚Äù he‚Äôs seen this before but otherwise it was a new one for everyone. Just adding this to my list of all the possible things to worry about when having sex now.

A young girl cries on a cold stone floor. She shivers and seizes as the blood pools around her skirts. Her mother will find her next to a cup of pennyroyal. She is buried in the village churchyard under a shroud of shame. A young boy attends the funeral and sheds a single tear, then turns to find comfort in the arms of another girl.

A woman in her forties walks down dark stairs to a darker basement. She hopes this won‚Äôt take long; she has three children at home, waiting for their dinner. She learned of this place from a friend of a friend. Whispered under the roar of machines meant to break their backs and their will. Waiting for her is a cold metal table and a cold hearted man telling her to lie down. She will not make it home for dinner.

A new woman, nineteen, and on her own for the first time. There‚Äôs a party tonight, and she wants to look her best. The music is loud and the house is crowded. She doesn‚Äôt care that it smells like stale beer and sweat. There is a cute boy in the corner who offers her a drink. She thinks he‚Äôs nice and takes it from him. The next morning she doesn‚Äôt remember the boy, doesn‚Äôt know why she is waking up on a strange floor, why she smells of stale beer and sweat. Three weeks later she takes a test. It is not the kind you can study for but still she gets a positive result. She tries to tell someone. They ask her: What were you wearing? Were you drunk? She can‚Äôt remember. Is this her fault, she asks herself. She asks the doctor. He says yes. You must live with the consequences. Consequences. The word echoes through her body as she drags the knife across her flesh.

A woman, newly married, full of promise, lays in a hospital bed. She caresses the swell of her stomach, whispers loving words. The doctors enter, frowns on their faces, and she feels the dread begin to rise. They use big words that she has read in books, in the sections she tries to avoid. Her husband‚Äôs knuckles whiten against the bed rail. Options, they ask together. One doctor shakes his head. Her daughter will grow up without her mother.

Twelve faces judge a woman wearing orange. It doesn‚Äôt matter her age. They call her a murderer. They call her a whore. They say she had no right. The judge and the law agree. Her tears mean nothing. She should have thought of this before. When, she asks herself, was she supposed to think about the rest of her life? At the doctor‚Äôs office? On the drive out of state? When her lover said he didn‚Äôt care? Or when they laid down together as they had so many times before? When she chose a pill over a copper device?

Dear Seemingly Uneducated School Board,

Unfortunately the problem that female anatomy is an inconvenience to you and is not important enough to miss school has been brought to attention, so here are some scenarios that may help you understand why some girls don‚Äôt want to go to school during ‚Äúthat time of the month‚Äù. Imagine that for one week straight every month of the year blood *oozes* out of one of the most sensitive parts in your body, it sounds annoying right? Now on top of that imagine that as the blood *oozes* out you have uncontrollable emotional outbursts. Then, add on the pain of a neverending muscle cramp. Now for that entire week of blood, unexplainable emotions, and the never ending cramp inside your stomach whose pain is equal to a heart attack, not going to school is not an option because letting a child stay home for more than ten unexcused absences is illegal. 

A girl usually has her period once a month for seven days making that sixty-three days a school year that a girl is on her period and only **ten** of those she can stay home. So for sixty-three days you go to school miserable and in pain because you would rather the school didn‚Äôt call social services on your parents *just* because you were experiencing menstruation. Not all girls will even need more than one day at home, but those ‚Äúone days‚Äù add up.

Every woman's period is different. Some have a blood flow so heavy that they resort to wearing all black along with having a tampon up, a pad down, and wearing their ugliest pair of underwear just in case they get ruined. Others may just be fine wearing a panty liner. Some have pain, some have none, and some have serious medical conditions that make cramps so bad they can barely walk. So whoever it was (male or female) that came out and said, ‚Äúhey, it really doesn‚Äôt hurt that bad, girls don‚Äôt need to stay home for this‚Äù can shove it right up their ass unless they have experienced every girl's pain. 

I am writing this letter because, believe it or not, **I am a female**. I remember having my first period. It was in the middle of a volleyball game when I squatted down and all of the sudden a gush of hot, sticky blood soaked right into my spandex. I spent the night crying of embarrassment and in pain, but I would still have to show up to school the next day. 

Lucky for me, I got to spend my day in the ER because I experienced a very common side effect of menstruation: An **ovarian cyst**. 

A cyst is a little pouch sitting on your ovary that fills with liquid causing pain or discomfort. A ruptured cyst is explained to be more painful than appendicitis and child labor. According to Sergio Vignali, who is an OB/Gyn physician, ‚Äúmost women develop at least one cyst every month‚Äù. Some females don‚Äôt even realize they have them and their cysts go away with their period. It depends on the female if the cyst will burst or not, but unfortunately I developed four cysts that burst all in the same day. So, go back to where you're pretending that you're oozing blood, crying, and cramping, and now add on a ticking time bomb sitting on your ovary that may or may not go off any given moment.

  Do *you* still want to go to school?

Now that you have a very *small* understanding of females go through during ‚Äúthat time of the month,‚Äù hopefully you will reconsider your attendance protocols because no, parents aren't committing truancy by letting their daughter stay home. They are taking care of their child's physical and emotional needs. So, until you put a woman's anatomy inside you and feel what they feel, **don‚Äôt** minimize their pain, just let them have the damn day off.

g36lad,WomensHealth,1587144979.0,"Today I found out what the real role of a hymen is. I was listening to [this podcast](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w3cszj31) on BBC sounds where two gynecologists were discussing issues related to women's reproductive systems, common myths, and harmful practices. Dr. Jen Gunter was asked about the hymen, and this is an excerpt from her response: 

*""The hymen exists to protect the infant vagina from urine and feces and dirt. Because right when you‚Äôre born, the vagina doesn‚Äôt have any estrogen and is incredibly vulnerable to irritants. As we start to walk and become continent of urine and feces, the hymen becomes pliable and takes on different shapes because we don‚Äôt need it anymore. So the hymen is the exact equivalent of baby teeth. It‚Äôs something that we needed developmentally for a small period of time, and then it‚Äôs discarded when we don‚Äôt need it anymore. It‚Äôs got different kinds of shapes and pliability, it‚Äôs in no way a reflection of virginity. That‚Äôs a social construct which is very harmful to women.""* 

I'm sharing this because it was the first time I had ever seen the explanation of the role of a hymen. Until now, I did not know what the role of a hymen was, I just thought it's just the tissue that exists. I knew it was unrelated to virginity, but I didn't know what it did, which I think is quite telling of the education we receive about the female reproductive system. I just wanted to share this information because I believe that it is very empowering to know your body.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/g36lad/psa_the_actual_role_of_a_hymen/,PSA: The actual role of a hymen,,537,44,1.0,Zanbakh

This happened two weeks ago.

It was a Thursday afternoon at work and my coworkers and I started to get a whiff of something... unsavory. This is not unusual because I work in the cancer center of a large hospital. As with any patient care role, you encounter a lot of smells that you didn't know even existed. And they can be bad.

This one was bad.

We wondered at first if it was a dead mouse, checking under desks and counters, or maybe the red biohazard bag hadn't been changed. We emptied all the trash cans and still the smell remained. It would come in wafts and seemed to follow us wherever we went.

That's when the usual ""oh God is it me?!"" fear kicked in. We smelled each other and checked our shoes but couldn't pinpoint the stench.

Around lunchtime I went to the employee lounge on the other side of the department, sat down, and had the sinking realization that that smell was definitely coming from me. Something was seriously wrong with my pussy and other people could *fucking smell it oh my god.*

I ran to the bathroom, dropped trou, and bent over to inspect my underwear. I had just finished my period a few days prior, so there was some brownish discharge, but that wasn't unusual. It did smell a little but it wasn't overpowering in that moment. I googled it (obviously) and found some info online about how sometimes discharge can be smelly at the end of your period. And mine have changed somewhat over the last year since I got an IUD so maybe that was it?

I anxiously completed the work day, my legs squeezed together whenever possible, and continued to help my coworkers search for a dead rat.

The worst moment was that at one point I moved my leg or something and a wave of the stink rose up like the Dark Mark. My coworker who was sitting by me actually stood up and moved. I wanted to die.

Friday went similarly except the smell was even worse. I was hoping it would magically disappear but no dice. Embarrassingly enough I actually threw away my underwear around 1pm (I had brought an extra) because the dried discharge smelled like actual death. I began to wonder if there was something going on here.

I made an appointment with planned parenthood for Monday evening and hoped it wasn't anything worse than a standard case of BV or something.

Over the weekend I warned my boyfriend of the chemical hazard brewing but we had sex anyways because we are trash. It was a horrible horrible decision ladies and gents. Afterwards his penis smelled god awful and my vagina felt like it was on fire. He gently assured me it was fine and didn't smell that bad but honestly the whole room reeked.

Monday I came equipped to work with a pack of pantyliners that I changed out every 45 minutes or so. The vagina goddesses were smiling upon me that day because this method worked and there was no noticeable smell that day.

Finally at long last I made it to my appointment and was anxiously waiting bare-bottomed under a paper sheet. The nurse had agreed that it seemed like a case of BV and some antibiotics would clear it right up.

The doctor came in and had me assume the position as we chatted about my symptoms. She was still talking as she inserted the speculum and stated to examine me but then stopped mid-sentence.

Slowly she closed her eyes, leaned back, and said ""Joyce, get the bag.""

I was thinking get the bag, GET THE BAG? FOR?!

And in that moment, she extracted the most disgusting tampon in the world from its horrible chamber. It's smell was instant and overpowering. I swear I heard it scream out as she tossed it in the biohazard bag.

I. Was. Mortified.

It must've been in there a week!! How could I forget a tampon?! How did my boyfriend not notice it?!

The doctor insisted it was actually pretty common and not to be embarrassed but holy shit.

o1dz3x,Healthyhooha,1623873675.0,"Hello from Vegas! I wanted to make a little update post because we finally have an answer and there's a lot that's happened since I made the original post.

If you recall, I had a very painful weeping ulcer on my vulva, along with some pelvic pain. I later noticed some yellow discharge. Everyone thought it was a Bartholin's Cyst until the gyno got a look at it and said he didn't know what it was but he wanted to test for herpes, the lab fucked up and tested it for covid, I was freaking out because the spot was healing and I didn't think I could get it retested.

So where are we now?

Well, about a day after I made the post, I requested a full panel of STI tests (including an HSV blood test, but my doctor said no to that one because of how unreliable they are). I spent a day out and about, and then woke up the next day in incredible pain. The spot was back and it was PISSED. I immediately requested to be seen again, somewhat hopeful that they could give the swab test another go. I saw a different (and, honestly nicer) gyno who swabbed me but also ordered the HSV blood test to corroborate the results. I got the blood drawn for some STI tests, and tried to get myself to pee in a cup for the rest of them. I am very bad at peeing on command so I ended up having to give up and go back TWICE to get anything to come out.

So, it's Monday morning, and my family and I are leaving for a little Vegas Father's Day trip in the afternoon. I am FINALLY able to pee in the cup to finish off all of the tests and as we head to Vegas, test results start coming in.

HIV? Negative
HepB? Negative
Syphilis? Negative
HSV-1 and HSV-2? Both negative from the swab (thank God)

Then, while sitting poolside I get a final notification, this one from the pee test, and announce probably too excitedly

""I HAVE CHLAMYDIA!""

So, here I am now, waiting to get my azithromycin prescription sent over to the CVS and getting another set up for my girlfriend, and through a few sitz baths the spot has healed up for real this time.

13g54iv,WomensHealth,1683946172.0,"Hi made a new account so I could do this anonymously. I know it's a dumb question but it bothers me a lot. Sorry for format, I'm on mobile.

When I was maybe 12 or younger I would do a regular yearly check up and during those exams my vagina would be examined. I never wanted to do that part of the exam but I had too. During the exams he would rub my clitoris until I was wet to ""see if it worked"" This was something that happened a few times and every time he did it I was extremely uncomfortable and felt dirty afterwards. After a few times I told my mom I would refuse to go to any future appointment until I could get a woman doctor. 

When I did get a doctor who was also a girl; I was never examined like that which made me confused.

It has bothered me a lot over the years especially when I was in college and my friends were getting pap smears and general wellness exams and I never heard of them going through that. 

Every time I would remember the experience I would just cry because it felt wrong. But maybe I'm overreacting . Please let me know your thoughts.

Edit 1: Sorry for a late response but thank you to everyone  for replying and being kind. I've been at work all day trying to make sure I don't look at my phone because I know I'll cry. Also to make sure there isn't any confusion I am very much an adult now, I got back pain and college loans!

1. I genuinely don't remember his name I know he has retired well over a decade now and I'm not even sure if he is alive. 

2. This also took place at a tribal clinic on my reservation that I am a member of so to be completely honest I genuinely believe nothing would ever happen to him. Other native/non native women I know/am related to that have been victims of sexual assault (not in a medical setting) never got justice. Also from my understanding it would be a state/federal issue as many tribes don't have the resources to prosecute and the cases are ever growing so many do get forgetton I'm sure.


3. I'm also scared to say something because I know IHS knew about Stanley Patrick Weber and they did nothing except move that doctor around to different tribal clinics.  I honestly don't think anything would happen. As much as I do want to say something. But you guys are right he probably has done this to others as well. I know my brothers got their physicals done by him as well and they had to do the whole turn your head and cough. My brothers never said anything to me about being uncomfortable by him. But I will try to look into reporting this and see if my brothers were hurt by him as well.

Therapy is something I definitely need. I struggle a lot with depression and anxiety; but I have gotten better control of my anxiety over the years which I'm proud of. I haven't had a panic attack in years. I did fear men when I was in middle/high school but I've gotten past it mostly. I also do avoid hospitals/clinics when possible and try to only interact with women when I have to go for an emergency.
I have a boyfriend who has been the only one I've opened to about this and he has been great at being supportive.

I can't think of anything else to say but thank you everyone for being kind and validating my gut feelings that this was actually wrong and not normal. This was always something I tried to brush aside but this always made me feel sick and made me cry when I would remember.

I told him I have really bad depression and anxiety and its been a rough couples years to where ive gone from 140 to 94 pounds. Everything was going fine until he walks in after ive undressed and on the table. He does not wash his hands he has a big cut on his hands and keeps fixing his face mask and proceds to pat the bottom of the table asking me to keep moving foward to his hands with no gloves on he is inches from my vagina. I ask him to please wash your hands and put gloves on.

He gets upset saying he washed his hands before coming in the room but if i need him to he can wash again. He washes them and comes back at me still no gloves on until i repeat over and over you need gloves. I feel like the procedure went on for longer than it should have and it hurt really bad. After wards he washes his hands and the nurse books it out of there to where its just us and im still undressed. he then sits maybe two feet away from me and starts going off about how I should trust my doctor and trust that he washed his hands in another room.

And asks how long ive been afraid of germs and been like this. I explain my germaphobia and my agoraphobias and this guy then says that's no way to live not really a point to livng. And then asks if I couldnt shake his hand then how is it I have a boyfriend and let him touch me? I'm like ughhh your a stranger. He then says i need therapy that most therapists use exposure theraphy and proceeds to rub his hand all over the lamp they use to see in the vagina better and says i bet you couldn't do this.

I know that most women on this app would know it was fake and probably a creepy man but I know there is young girls on this subreddit and I don‚Äôt want any poor girl falling for this. I assume because I included that I was 19 in my post that they thought I would fall for it. It makes me sick that their are people out there who do this, please stay safe! 

The account was grouchy_quiet_1934 but they will most likely have changed the account name by now I‚Äôm guessing :(

EDIT: IT HAPPENED AGAIN I just checked my dm‚Äôs and it happened again omg. I saw an account had sent me a dm and accepted because I thought it might be a women who had seen this post wanting to talk about it. They had sent multiple messages which were this:

hi
i have the same issue
my vaginal area is too much itchy and rashes over  labia burning like hell
antifungals not working in this case
hello

The accounts reddit username cuckoo1991. I looked at the account because these messages were clearly fake and they literally have made posts about infertility because of their sperm count, and have multiple posts where they mention they‚Äôre a male. What‚Äôs even worse is in the infertility post I saw him mention he‚Äôs 31 which is so gross, I don‚Äôt know if he was trying to solicit pictures or anything because I immediately reported and blocked him but it‚Äôs gross enough that he pretended to have the same problem. 

I‚Äôm just in disbelief that it happened again especially after I‚Äôve made this post which anyone can see on my profile, and the fact it was so obvious when you clicked his profile that it was a man, he literally had a question about sperm count. Anyways I reported the messages this time! And blocked him so hopefully reddit will take action. 

Thank you all for the advice and comments! I hope nobody gets manipulated by either of these sick men :(",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/po7pkn/be_careful_on_this_subreddit/,Be careful on this subreddit!,Support/Personal Experience ,439,27,0.99,charlieee000

ejjjc4,Healthyhooha,1578076462.0,"hi! my name is Rebecca and i am currently in the midst of my first UTI. i have no clue how i got it, think it might‚Äôve been from using the same preparation h wipe in the front that i had already wiped in the back.

anyway, i had the uti for a whole ass month before i realized something was wrong. i had sorta been forcing myself to pee, it didn‚Äôt just come out. that was a month ago.

i started getting light pains in my sides when i was using the bathroom. didn‚Äôt think much of it. i was busy, under a lot of stress with finals and the health of my sick cat, and just thought it would go away.

i started a new job, with easy restroom access. my coworker, who is a family friend, asked me if everything was okay when i went to the rest room multiple times in one hour. blew it off like everything was fine, because i didn‚Äôt know.

around three weeks ago, whenever i urinated, it was blurry. meh, maybe i should incorporate more water in my diet. maybe i ate something weird. not insanely alarming to me.

about a week and a half ago, i would urinate, and instantly cringe from the stench. it was putrid, disgusting, yuck! thought it was something i ate.

on monday night, at 2am, i decided to take a UTI test strip. maybe this was my issue! i drank some water, had to go 25 minutes later. took the test, and boom! both sides of the strip were dark purple in less than a minute. oops.

good thing i took it when i did, i woke up tuesday morning, worst pain i have felt in a while. my kidneys were killing me. i set up a doctors appointment for thursday, since they couldn‚Äôt get me in that day. a few hours later, i decided i couldn‚Äôt wait. 

‚Äúwould you be mad at me if i asked to go to urgent care?‚Äù is what i asked my mom, she said no, then off i went.

the time passes, they checked my urine sample, the doctor walks in, ‚Äúyou have an extremely severe infection.‚Äù she also told me that i would‚Äôve been in the hospital by thursday if i didn‚Äôt go to urgent care. i would‚Äôve lost kidney function or even died from sepsis by next week. 

got a nice shot in the bum, got some antibiotics.

what i‚Äôm trying to say is, please know the signs of a uti and don‚Äôt blow them off because you‚Äôre busy. i could‚Äôve been in the hospital for new years if i didn‚Äôt go to urgent care that day. i‚Äôll keep everyone updated about how i‚Äôm doing!! i got stronger antibiotics yesterday and my cultures aren‚Äôt back yet.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/ejjjc4/it_took_me_18_years_to_get_my_first_uti_and_i_was/,"it took me 18 years to get my first uti and i was dumb and didn‚Äôt recognize the symptoms, and now my kidneys might be permanently damaged or dead.",,421,41,0.99,rebbiestef

I had very large labia minora, particularly on one side, that would chafe no matter what underwear I wore. I also had to pull them aside during penetrative sex because they would get ""pulled in"", tug, and hurt.

It has been 1 year since my labiaplasty and my life has improved immensely. The surgeon did nothing to my clitoral hood; it was all just reduction of the labia minora. All-in cost was $4400 (surgeon fee, anesthesia, hospital fee, medications). I took 5 days off work and had sex 3 weeks post-surgery with no pain or issues.

The surgeon didn't berate me at all for my age even tho other women I've told say it wasn't worth it since my labia will change when (if) I have kids. I live in the DC area and the surgeon said most of his patients are cyclists who get a labiaplasty because of the chafing. Not sure what else to say now other than it worked for me, I have not regretted my labiaplasty, and I am extremely pleased with the results.

Ladies- vaginas have a natural scent. It doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs bad or that something is wrong. 

I worry because I see so many posts talking about the way things smell and I‚Äôm not convinced that it‚Äôs always bad. Everything gets labeled BV. And that‚Äôs a legitimately common thing. 

But. BV and yeast have distinct smells. Just because you smell ‚Äúsomething‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre having an issue. 

BV is fishy. If you smell fishy (and it‚Äôs distinct) then it‚Äôs cause for concern. Yeast (not always but sometimes) actually can smell like baking bread. Yeast is often more discernible by the consistency of your discharge and by itching and burning. BV and feel that way too, but the discharge is different. It‚Äôs often more watery. 

I‚Äôm just saying it because it‚Äôs a good reminder that vaginas don‚Äôt smell like nothing, nor should they smell like roses. Everyone has a different scent. So please take this into account before you post worried about things and get ‚Äúdiagnosed‚Äù with something you may or may not have. 

I‚Äôm a healthcare worker and I‚Äôve seen vaginas. Smelled vaginas, though not intentionally. When something is actually wrong, it‚Äôs noticeably wrong. 

Just a PSA to remind us all that vaginas can have a scent and it‚Äôs not always indicative of something being wrong.

ujdet1,WomensHealth,1651804184.0,"The title pretty much sums up this post. This is just a jumbled rant because I just need to vent to other women. I‚Äôm sorry in advance if it‚Äôs not cohesive! So many emotions!! 

I (26f) am pregnant - confirmed by 4 home pregnancy tests and a recent doctor‚Äôs visit. I am married to my wonderful husband, we both are college educated, and financially capable. I know this is a hot topic.. I feel like opinions are thrown in my face whether I‚Äôm on Twitter, FB, instagram, etc. I am not only reminded of my reality when I‚Äôm wasting time on social media, but also when my body randomly decides to become nauseated or so tired that I can‚Äôt hold my eyes open. 

I am unable to share the difficulty and heartache of this circumstance with either of our families (pro-lifers) - our support system is sh*t when it comes to this topic. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here, rambling incoherently. It was never our goal to have kids (mind you we have been sexually active going on 5 years with ZERO pregnancy scares). Now, here we are! There were reasons to believe my husband was infertile; however, I assure you precautions were taken nonetheless to prevent this, but again, here we are! 

As crazy as this sounds, part of me wishes I had a reason to not carry this baby other than not wanting one for my own. I feel immense guilt, and honestly, I know I shouldn‚Äôt but I do! I cry as I type this. I‚Äôm scared of what‚Äôs to come tomorrow, I‚Äôm scared this guilt is going to be carried with me for life, but I know (and have felt this my whole life) that I don‚Äôt want to be a mom. 

If you‚Äôve read this far, I sincerely thank you for listening to me. I love my husband dearly and he supports me 110% in everything, but I feel like I just need to get this off my chest to other women. Why? I have no idea! I‚Äôm a freakin emotional mess!! I just need to hear words of encouragement, support, or anything from other women who have gone through this or who know someone who has faced this. It‚Äôs not a decision made lightly. Truly, this is the most gut wrenching thing I‚Äôve ever endured. 

Thank you for listening ‚ù§Ô∏è

EDIT: Finally, I have figured out how to edit a post on Reddit!!!

I wanted to take a week or so before I edited this post to share how I am doing for those who have reached out and asked. 

Like I said, it has now been a week since I took the first pill and it has been six days since I inserted the remaining 4 pills vaginally. I am thinking about sharing my experience in a separate (more detailed post) in the hopes of possibly helping other women who might be going through the emotions of pregnancy and abortion. I don‚Äôt know how much help I would be, but maybe it would also be some help in my healing journey as well? Just some random thoughts! 

Anyways, I want to THANK each of you who have supported me in one of the most vulnerable times in my life. I never knew how kind strangers of the internet could be, but I am so grateful that I had you all to uplift me, listen to me, and make me feel supported when I TRULY felt like I was a monster in my own skin. 

I am happy to say that I am doing better. After taking the first pill, I did feel relief. I won‚Äôt lie, I cried a lot both Friday and Saturday (and still do cry now - it‚Äôs way less often) but at the end of the day, I am happy of my choice and would choose abortion if I had to do this over again. I have learned that crying and sadness does not have a correlation to regret in my instance. I have no regrets. In fact, my emotions and feelings are just all over the fucking place because *insert hormone overload*! Also, my husband is the best (I know I‚Äôm biased), but he was with me every step of the way, and I can‚Äôt thank him enough for just being supportive in any way possible. He also told off the protestors outside of the clinic, but that‚Äôs a whole other story lol. 

I‚Äôll end with this thought:
I am so damn happy that there are individuals (like you all) out here supporting women and their CHOICE and truly coming to me in a place of love and empathy - not judgment or hatred. I walk away from this rollercoaster event in my life both empowered and proud that I got to make this choice for myself!

n7nuxp,WomensHealth,1620475621.0,"I hope anyone considering medical 
abortion or who has experienced an abortion complication finds this article and it helps you in some way...

I was 30, sober, happy, healthy. I was told by doctors at 19 I'd never naturally have children so had not taken or used any form of birth control in that 11 year period. During my divorce, I got pregnant the very first time I had sex with a new partner. So I was legally married but separated from husband and now dealing with a lifelong decision that I had never prepared for or wanted to prepare for. I had fully planned on never having children as natural pregnancy wasnt possible right? Wrong.

At 7 weeks pregnant I was miserable. I suddenly hated all tastes foods smells drinks perfumes sounds lights noises. I hated everything. I hated myself.  I wanted to die. I was suicidal. I developed oral and vaginal thrush and it still hasnt gone away 8 months later even after 3 treatments and trust me when I say I have tried every vitamin supplement herb spice natural remedy medication etc you can name.

I finally decided not to proceed with the pregnancy and the moment I made the Planned Parenthood (PP) appointment I felt relief. It took 10 minutes on the website and 5 days later I drove myself there terrified and alone. 

The office was unfriendly, quiet, awkward, uncomfortable, unprofessional. The nurses and doctors were cold and distant. I saw my ultrasound one more time, cried softly and said to my belly ""I am so sorry I couldn't be stronger for you.""

A nurse asked me some questions. Tried to prescribe me pain meds I just told her I was allergic to. Luckily I caught it and refused the prescription. A ""doctor"" walked in wearing a polo shirt and said ""take this pill now and another tonight at 12am. Follow these directions if you have questions."" I asked if there were ANY RISKS OF COMPLICATIONS I SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT. The doctor said I was more likely to die from birth and walked out.

I took the first pill and drove 2 hours home. Took the second at 12am as instructed and by 4am ....it was like a demonic presence had entered the room. The pain was so intense I was hallucinating, sweating, moaning, shaking, gagging. It was the worst pain I had ever experienced and it did not stop for hours. I finally got in a hot bath for an hour (as suggested by PP website) and finally passed out at 6am. Slept til 4pm. Woke up with an appetite and a little sore but no biggie. Felt better already.

Until 5 days later. Excessive clotting and bleeding. Bled through my pants 3x in one day when I had never done that once before. My blood starting to smell rotten like fish and metal. Long thick strings were coming out with the blood which I later learned was just coagulated infection. I called the PP triage line and they said it was pretty normal.  

By day 7 I could barely walk, sit or stand and eventually developed a fever of 103. I was shaking uncontrollablly but managed to drive myself to ER.

The nurses immediately start insisting that ""you MUST have an STD."" Because the only known causes for PID and Septic Shock after a medical abortion is 4 forms of bacteria in the vagina or an incomplete abortion. All my blood tests and urine and ultrasounds came back completely normal and negative. I am literally a 2% statistic and cannot find any further research as to why this happened. Neither can doctors. 

So they pump me full of life saving antibiotics which did in fact save my life. They had given me 3 day life expectancy if the antibiotics didnt work but they did. Great right? Well...

The antibiotics were so strong it caused a series of other infections and complications they cannot diagnose or treat. I was back in the hospital again 6 months later with ulcerative colitis. I still have thrush growing in my body. I have lost 15lbs (down to 95lbs today) and am literally skin and bones. Malnourished. Weak. Doctors do not know wtf caused this and clearly how tf to help me. 

So every day now I wake up and advocate for my own health. I read, research, diet, exercise. I question my prescription medications. I question doctors knowledge and abilities. I question everything. Because if we dont question them who will? The FDA doesnt. The CDC doesnt. I am the only reliable advocate for my mind body and health. 

I wanna hear how you advocated for your health before during or after abortion or pregnancy. What did you learn? What would you change? How did this affect your beliefs and views.

jkdzwh,Healthyhooha,1603991147.0,"This happened a few months ago while I was trying to get a diagnosis for an obscure issue, but every time I think about it I get pissed off all over again. 

I was experiencing recurring fissuring of the perineum despite going months without sex with my boyfriend (he was studying abroad), and she was the first provider I saw for the issue. At the time of this appointment, I didn't know I was actually fissuring, I just thought I was chafed because I was experiencing intense burning upon penetration. After doing an exam, she said everything looked completely normal (later, another provider showed me the exact source of my pain), so I asked her why I could be experiencing such intense pain. She mentioned the possibility that I might have vulvodynia, but I explicitly told her that I have bled a little bit after sex, so vulvodynia seems unlikely since there was a clear cause of the pain (the blood isn't just coming from nowhere). She insisted I wasn't torn (again, she was proven wrong later), so I began suggesting possible causes for the burning since my initial thought was shot down.

I mentioned the possibility of dryness; I explained that I never felt that I am dry during sex, but I don't know what being dry feels like. Her response? 

""*Even if you are, then so what?""* 

Strike number 1.

I explained that I was simply trying to identify a cause, to then hopefully try to self-treat and prevent the pain from happening again. I then asked if hormonal fluctuations cause dryness and/or pain, and she gave me a definitive ""no,"" that my specific pill would actually cause me to be wetter (she never explained why). I find it personally unnerving when doctors refuse to admit that a drug can cause side effects, even rare ones, because weird stuff happens to random people. It's unfair to categorically declare that something cannot possibly cause a side effect, unless there is very conclusive science behind the claim. She rounded it off with the insensitive, sexist comment in the title of this post, with a scoff and a dismissive shake of the head. 

""Women love to blame everything on their hormones."" 

I'm sure you see why I was pissed and refuse to see this provider in the future. Firstly, I was just trying to suggest causes to figure out how to help myself, but she seemed to be threatened by this. I am not an abrasive person, and people often regard me as kind and friendly, so I know I wasn't coming off as rude. Secondly, the obvious sexism in the comment, coming from ANOTHER WOMAN. As if men and society at large don't blame testosterone for men's behavior?! Up to and including violent crimes?! She acted as if hormones are a uniquely female narrative. Also, maybe we consider hormones to be the culprit for a lot of things because THEY JUST ARE. Our moodiness before our periods, bleeding gums at random times of the month, and other seemingly unrelated physical symptoms can all be ATTRIBUTED TO HORMONES. Overall, she was dismissive of my issue (and turned out to be wrong!), dismissive of the female gender, and dismissive of science. 

I've warned all my friends to avoid this provider at all costs (I'm a student at a university, this provider works at our health center).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/jkdzwh/a_female_practitioner_said_to_me_women_love_to/,"A (female) practitioner said to me, ""women love to blame everything on their hormones.""",Rant ü§¨,365,30,0.99,meem_queen

She performed an ultrasound to see what was wrong and discovered a 10.5 cm cyst in my left ovary. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. We scheduled surgery for the following week and meanwhile she prescribed meds to control the pain I went in for originally. 

A few days go by and I notice some spotting in my underwear. I check and it was an ingrown hair that had popped, soon after that, the pain went away completely! Of course I still went ahead with the surgery and now I am recovering and grateful I went for a check up ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π.

I‚Äôm 24, Asian and a virgin. I have never had any sexual encounters with anyone - not even a kiss. No one has ever seen me naked apart from when I had my nappy changed as a kid. I‚Äôve had interest from men before but my vagina is holding me back. As soon as I was 11 (hit puberty), I started to get clusters of bumps, which have a white head. I thought I had a STD from sitting on a toilet seat (lol) but after research as a kid I later realised they are fordyce spots.

The thing is, I‚Äôve never ever seen a case as severe as mine. I‚Äôve seen every photo on the internet and read every post on Reddit about this but I have huge clusters of white spots( like over 100+) over my labia, clitoris hood, Anus, everywhere down there / it‚Äôs all covered!!! (which is very dark, so it‚Äôs VERY visible). Just imagine acne everywhere down there. It‚Äôs also VERY wrinkly. I can‚Äôt even look at my own vagina because it looks so bad. I‚Äôve literally contemplated ending my life over this.

I really want to go to the doctors but the thought of it drives me into a panic attack. I‚Äôve never spoken about this to my mum as talking about vaginal health is a very awkward and taboo topic in the Asian culture. I‚Äôve only mentioned it to my friends who said it‚Äôs ‚Äòrazor bumps‚Äô (which is literally impossible as hair cannot grow where my spots are) which made me even more embarsssed. I just nodded and agreed. 

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm looking for by posting this.. I want to go see someone about it, I‚Äôm just feeling so helpless and embarrassed. I‚Äôm very insecure that my hooha looks like this and is wrinkly üò≠

1agckf8,Healthyhooha,1706798558.0,"I've struggled with chronic UTIs for a decade, and do you know what it took to finally overcome it? Leaving Canada.

Let me begin by acknowledging the shortage of healthcare workers and their Hardwork, even if they are stretched thin and burning out. Hopefully, conditions will improve for them to receive the recognition they truly deserve.

My journey began in Kazakhstan when I experienced the usual burning sensation. Initially, I thought I'd resort to my usual routine of getting antibiotics to save my ruined vacation. However, my in-laws insisted on taking me directly to a urologist, something that felt impossible back in Canada. My family doctor, when I had one, never really warmed up to the idea of referring me.

In Kazakhstan, the urologist started with a cystoscopy (uncomfortable but not painful), blood tests, and swabs. To my surprise, testing for Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma was routine here.

The results revealed chronic UTIs and a positive diagnosis for Ureaplasma. The prescribed solution included 10 days of bladder irrigation (not as awful as it sounds, surprisingly, with iodine in the mixture), 5 days of doxycycline, and a bunch of probiotics to restore my flora.

I can‚Äôt believe it took me a year to get diagnosed with this. My quality of life was being severely affected with constant pain. It felt like I had gotten a tattoo on my clitoris, and every time I peed it burned like hell. Sex had been incredibly painful too, and I kept getting yeast infections, so bad to the point where my urethra was so irritated I was occasionally peeing blood. 

My gynecologists ran so many tests, and I still had intense pain after everything came back clear, except for an abnormal pap smear, which they told me to come back in a YEAR. They prescribed me a steroid ointment and a numbing gel, which didn‚Äôt help. It got to the point where I almost went to the ER because the pain was so bad it just hurt to be alive. 

I knew something was still wrong with my body, so I ordered an STD test from LetsGetChecked.com, which also tests for Ureaplasma & Mycoplasma, which is what I was starting to suspect. A few days later, they call me, tell me I have Gardnerella, and I was able to get prescribed medication and have it in my hands that same day. 

I was prescribed the antibiotic Metronidazole for 7 days, and the medication started to work so quickly. My pain was cut down in half 2 days later. It‚Äôs now day 7 and I am feeling amazing down there. I forgot what it was like to not have chronic pain, or pee without it burning. 

Doctors don‚Äôt usually test for Gardnerella because it is a bacteria found in healthy women, but an overgrowth of this bacteria can cause severe pain. I was worried that it was an STI from a partner, but only people with vaginas can be affected by this bacteria.

Every year about 30% of us will have bacterial vaginosis (BV), a condition in which the vaginal microbiome is out of whack. BV isn't just embarrassing, it's actually also implicated in increased risk of HIV acquisition, tubal infertility and even preterm birth. But the science about vaginal microbiomes, and how to fix them when they're no longer carrying out their protective role, is super out of date - and sometimes just plain wrong. This is ridiculous. It's the 21st century and there's still no good characterisation of the most common women's health issue. It's why I set up The Juno Study, the world's largest IRB approved study for decoding the vaginal microbiome. We launched the study on September 13th 2019. For every one of the 1000 women that joins us on our mission, by submitting a vaginal swab - think q-tip - using our prepaid kit in the mail, we send back a free vaginal microbiome report as a thank you.

So for almost a year now, I‚Äôve struggled with excessive discharge. Like really excessive. I would soak up a pair of panties in just an hour some days. I went to like 5 gynecologist.

I did ultrasounds and everything. I was so confused.

But one day, I went to another gynecologist. I was so tired and I was expecting the same answer ‚Äúnothing wrong you are good‚Äù. But he took me seriously. He listened to me. He was not stressed and I told him how hard this was for me. That I don‚Äôt understand, that I‚Äôve been to so many doctors.

Nothing has worked. Multiple rounds of antibiotics. Azo. Cranberry extract. D mannose. Chugging water till I literally feel like I‚Äôm going to throw up.  Even prophylactic nitrofurantoin. the last uti I got almost got me sent to the ER. And after this he put his foot down and said he‚Äôs not having sex with me until I get better. 

but what if I don‚Äôt get better? It‚Äôs been a year of this. And no doctor, gynaecologist, urologist, nurse or any healthcare professional has taken it seriously. 

Last night, I came out of the bathroom after being hunched over in pain for two hours, before caving and taking two Advil liquid gels (the amount I take for the UTIs is probably way too much and bad for my liver). I laid with him and started crying. Then he started crying. I think we both realized that there‚Äôs a looming expiration date to an otherwise perfect relationship. 

He admitted he didn‚Äôt think he could be in a sexless relationship and then we just cried for hours because neither of us knows how to fix it. I feel like he is going to give up on me and I‚Äôll be all alonstill dealing with this :(

I can‚Äôt keep antibiotics forever. I feel like doctors don‚Äôt have a solution for me. I have another appointment with the urologist in august and I feel like he‚Äôs just going to be like ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing I can do for you‚Äù and that‚Äôll be it

Edit: first I want to thank all the helpful suggestions. I really appreciate it. I‚Äôm going to ask for a different urologist (preferably female) at my appointment today, in addition to all the tests that were suggested. 

Secondly, I urge the people who are commenting on my relationship to please keep their thoughts to themselves. He has been there for me every step of the way. He‚Äôs left work to pick me up and bring me home/doctor when I have symptoms, he‚Äôs come to doctors appointments, taken all the tests I‚Äôve asked him to, we‚Äôve developed a really strict routine pre and post sex. He gets my meds for me, feeds me when I feel ill, and will sit with me in the bathroom until 2-3 in the morning to make sure I‚Äôm ok. 
The people saying that he is ‚Äúusing me‚Äù are completely out of line. Anyone with a chronic illness that affects their sex life will tell you how much of a toll it takes on your relationship. he does not want to hurt me anymore, so he has said that we should stop having sex for a while. The problem is, no doctor has been able to help me long term, so we don‚Äôt know how long a ‚Äúwhile‚Äù is. This has been happening for 8 months. Is it fair to ask him lol to be celibate for almost a year when there is no solution in sight? No I don‚Äôt feel comfortable asking that of him.

Thinkx is under scrutiny for having per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances aka PFA‚Äôs in their products, even though they advertise their products as ‚Äúnon-toxic, organic, and environmentally safe.‚Äù These PFA‚Äôs are toxic chemicals that are apparently quite commonly found in non-stick cookware as well as water repellent goods. Thinkx products contained very very high amounts of these chemicals, which are known to cause cancer and reproductive harm. 

I figured this group would be a good place to share some links and information for others who are users of period underwear, so you can choose the safest, non toxic products for yourself.

orr4cx,Healthyhooha,1627272577.0,"I wanted to share my story of having a vaginal tumor. I searched so many different subs for anyone who had an experience like mine, but I couldn't find anything that was similar to my experience. I read a lot of experiences with cancers, and those made me feel even worse while I waited for biopsy results. The beginning of my diagnosis was extremely lonely because I couldn't find any stories from others online who had symptoms like mine. 

I was misdiagnosed with vaginismus last year (October 2020). My symptoms started as pain with sex (only on the left side) and progressed to unprovoked electric shock shooting pain from left side of clitoris down to left side of vagina. I eventually developed pain with bending over, running, doing stairs, and unprovoked stinging at the site of my tumor.

I did pelvic floor PT for seven months with minimal success. I stopped progressing in PT after a few months. Eventually, a provider sent me for a pelvic MRI in June. The MRI showed that I had a lesion in my vagina exactly where all my pain was occurring. I had actually palpated this mass back in April, but I was told it was a trigger point in the muscle. I'm really not sure how this was missed during the TWELVE pelvic exams I had had since seeking treatment for my pain with sex. The impression on the radiology report suggested aggressive angiomyxoma. I was referred to see a gyn oncologist and saw her the day after my MRI. They told me they didn't know what this was and mentioned possible malignancy. I underwent a biopsy about a week later. Waiting for results was absolutely agonizing. I read awful stories about people having vaginal cancers and undergoing radiation and vaginectomies while I waited for results. There was a lot of crying throughout this whole process. I finally heard back that my tumor was benign and thankfully not an aggressive angiomyxoma! There are zero reported cases in the literature of my tumor occurring in the vagina, so they're writing a case study about it.

I had surgery last week and am post-op day 3 now. My tumor was extremely low in my vagina that it could actually be palpated through the skin externally (wasn't visible externally tho). I was put under general anesthesia for surgery. Since my tumor was right up next to my urethra, I had to go home with a catheter. Which I'm going to have until Tuesday. My pain has been well controlled with Tylenol and ibuprofen for the most part. My pain post-op is so much better than my pain was before surgery. The catheter is honestly the worst part. My vulva is extremely swollen, and she is not pretty to look at. My clitoris is so bruised that it's black and blue. But I'm doing well and will hopefully be able to have pain free sex again in the future once I'm healed from surgery and given the all clear. 

I hope this helps someone else in the future going through gyn surgery or some sort of gyn issue benign or malignant.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/orr4cx/i_had_a_tumor_removed_from_my_vagina/,I had a tumor removed from my vagina!,,337,20,1.0,ellenthymelon

I was raised in a very frugal household. My routine is I would wake up, use a wet flannel to wipe my neck, chest and armpits, and then use some ¬£1 roll on deodorant. I would shower twice a week, shampoo my hair. That‚Äôs it. We never owned soap or body lotion, moisturisers or anything like that. I know nothing about these things, what I need or how to use them.

It has come to my attention that this is not the correct way of doing things ? And I would be really interested to learn how to do things properly / what I‚Äôm supposed to be doing, but I have no idea where to start ! I would love my skin and hair to be healthier (which falls under skincare and haircare I suppose, which are things I never thought about because I always considered them a luxury way out of my reach) and I would also love to not smell. My armpits (and by extension my shirts) smell and I‚Äôve always just been quietly embarrassed about that, thinking there was nothing I could do. 

Any guidance would be massively appreciated.

1) If you sleep with a pad, in order to not soil the bed by period blood running down the buttcrack when you sleep on your back, WEDGIE the pad between your buttcheeks. I do this before I go to bed, and it has become an automatic thing to check it quickly every time I change sleeping positions.


2) Use Ibuprofen or naproxen for cramps! Not paracetamol, it simply doesn't work as well and it has been proven. Also, the earlier you take it the less of a bad time you will have. Don't wait until the cramps are really bad, take it just when you feel the cramps starting (if you know you can get bad cramps). Overnight I take it proactively bc I know I will wake up in severe pain otherwise..you don't wake up from the pain until it's quite bad (This is for ""normal"" cramps. If you think you could have endometriosis, please try to get professional advice)

3) Pee after sex! Yes, as soon as possible after. All types of sex. Don't wait too long.

After an exceptionally vigorous sexy time, I passed out and forgot to go pee. I honestly was exhausted and figured, meh one time, no big deal. ( hindsight 20/20 ... this was not a good idea). I woke up later, cleaned up and carried on with life. 


A few days later I felt itchy. I thought at first I had a yeast infection but quickly realized ( after my 8th trip to pee in 2 hours) that it appeared I had a UTI. Shit. This was around 10/1. I called my doctor and we did a televisit. I described symptoms, how long I‚Äôd had them and he agreed , Yep, sounds like UTI. He was going to call in an antibiotic and some diflucan. Awesome- also this is a new antibiotic. I‚Äôm allergic to penicillin and erythromycin so I‚Äôm leery about any antibiotics but this, this was a 1 dose deal! Monurol. 

So I wait. Check my app as it always notifies me when any rx‚Äôs are ready. Nothing. It‚Äôs now after 6 and the dr office is closed. My bladder is spasming like crazy and no damn prescription. I‚Äôm miserable. I try a couple of OTC things and just suffer until the next morning.

That‚Äôd be great- thanks 

By the way- that one shot antibiotic? WITH INSURANCE was $70.... ffs 
But I got, I took it and waited.
Kinda felt better. This was Friday. Sunday and I was like great this over!!! 

Then Tuesday happened. From the time I woke up at 6 to noon, my UTI came back with a vengeance. I ended up in the ER and had a Ct scan because my back was hurting so bad. Multiple IV pain meds, antibiotics and confirmation that my UTI was not cleared up ( duh) I was sent home on new meds and told to feel better. 

Fast forward one week. I‚Äôd been having some low back pain which I attributed to my shitty work chair. Until Thursday afternoon. I felt bad. Achy, hot and nauseous. I left work early and told my boyfriend I was going to his house to crash. I barely made it there - on my way I started shivering so hard I could hardly hold the wheel. Got in his house and just crawled in bed. I was burning up. I knew it but couldn‚Äôt do anything or care. I was having a hard time breathing but figured it was because I was hot. I used my inhaler and laid down again. My boyfriend came home and took my temp- 102 ( normal for me is 97.3) I managed to get a call in to my dr again and had an appointment to see them first thing in the morning with the instructions if I got worse to go to the ER. 

I took various pain relievers and some Benadryl and tried to sleep. My fever would drop for a little while and then spike again. My back pain was worse and it was getting even more difficult to breathe. All I wanted to do was make it to 7. My kid needed a ride to work and then I was going to the dr. Dammit that‚Äôs all I was focused on. 

6 :30 I woke up and sat up. When the light hit my legs I realized something was wrong. I angled it better and scanned my whole leg starting at my ankle and sweeping up to my thigh. 

Hives. I was covered in hives. I lifted my shirt. My belly was covered in hives. My chest and arms. The inside of my mouth had them. I was allergic to this stupid antibiotic. 

I got myself dressed. Called and Told my child to find a way to work and drove myself to the ER. It was probably the shortest desk to triage to bed time I‚Äôve ever had. My reaction and subsequent infection was bad enough to get me admitted to the hospital for 3 days for IV antibiotics.

k46g5r,Healthyhooha,1606773830.0,"Hello everyone,

I would like to submit this post as a bit of warning to any women here who have begun taking wellbutrin/bupropion.

After taking Lexapro for about 3-4 months early this year and experiencing a crazy drop in libido and weight gain, my doctor switched my to wellbutrin about 6 months ago.

At first everything was fine (I thought). My libido returned and was able to lose weight which was awesome. About a month or so in, I started experiencing what I believed at the time to be an insane  yeast infection: My symptoms were crazy itchiness, redness, swollen labia, painful sex, fissures (tiny cuts around vagina from dryness), and pain/irritation near the opening of my vagina. These symptoms seemed to be recurring, I'd have a few days of relief and then the issue would come back. Sex was IMPOSSIBLE. After rounds of medication for this ""yeast infection"" and no relief, I went to the doctor and had myself tested for all STDs and came back negative. Feeling defeated, I kept trying to mitigate the symptoms with other treatments (sitz baths, etc). I went to the doctor again months later after STILL no relief, and was diagnosed with cytolytic vaginosis, which has no real cure. I was also told that I couldn't have unprotected sex with my boyfriend (lol...excuse me?) because the issue was his semen was irritating me ....completely out of nowhere! Looking back, the doctors really were as baffled as I was.

It was about 6 months of hell. Severe pain, not knowing why, and not knowing how to stop it. Whatever improvements I got by switching from lexapro and getting my libido back were ruined again by this new set of vaginal problems that also made sex impossible and began to impact my mental health and relationship as well.

About 2 months ago, my partner and I were doing process of elimination to try to think about what has changed this year for me to find a root cause. The only thing we could think of was switching to wellbutrin. I did a LOT of research and vaginal irritation and swelling were rarely listed as side effects, and if it was listed, it was wayyyyy at the bottom of the ""rare"" list. So I wasn't fully convinced, but we had no other leads, plus the timeline did kind of line up with when the issues started. So I took a few days break from the wellbutrin just to see what would happen.

Within 4 days, all of my symptoms were gone. I could not believe it.

I scheduled a meeting with my psych and told him about what had been going on and he immediately said ""let's take another 2 week break and see if the issue stays away"". So I did. Symptoms never returned. Since then I have stopped wellbutrin completely (I was on 300 mg I believe), and I am happy to report that I am better than ever. No more pain or irritation, I can have a normal, spontaneous sex life with my partner without the anxiety of the whole thing hurting! I can pee without it burning! It has had a stronger mental health improvement than the medication ever did. About a month ago I went to have a new doctor re-test me for cytolytic vaginosis as I was diagnosed before, and the doctor found nothing and that I was/am perfectly healthy. I feel that way too now.

I'm writing this here because when I was 65 chrome tabs deep into my research and in the throws of pain, I could barely find anyone sharing a similar experience or drawing this connection. If any woman reading this is on this wellbutrin/bupropion and experiencing severe vaginal issues, seemingly out of nowhere, it could very well be this medication!

EDIT: I wrote this post a year ago and still get DOZENS of messages about this. I am so glad it‚Äôs been helpful and I hope women continue to find it and get the relief they need (if this applies to them). Always discuss with your psych before discontinuing your medication.

So I went to see a gynecologist as soon as I could, and though he thought it was a Bartholin's Gland Cyst when I described it, once he got down there he said he actually wasn't sure what was going on. So he swabbed it to be tested for herpes. This scared the shit out of me, but I stayed strong and vowed to not panic until I saw the results. He sent me home with a course of acyclovir just in case and some topical lidocaine to relieve the pain. 

I got an email later that night saying I had test results available, and when I went to check, all I had was a negative COVID test. I did not take a COVID test.

So the past few days I had been calling the office and talking to a whole assortment of people trying to figure out what happened, and the whole time the bump is healing nicely and I'm in way less pain because of the lidocaine.

This morning I got a call saying that apparently the lab had mislabeled my swab and tested my vagina for covid instead of herpes! And, now that the spot was healed over, they couldn't retest it!

So now I don't know if the spot healed because of the acyclovir or just went away on its own, I still don't have a definitive reason why it happened in the first place, and I have no idea what to tell my girlfriend.

I guess I just want to know where to go from here? I also have some photos of the spot at its worst vs how it looks now, if anyone is interested in getting a look at it themselves.

Edit: I'm currently in talks with my doctor about getting the HSV blood test as well as blood and urine tests for other STIs. I'll try to keep yall updated. Also, it should be worth mentioning that the last direct sexual contact I had was in January (with a man). I've had a girlfriend since mid-March but we haven't had any oral-genital or genital-genital contact.

ju5bi3,Healthyhooha,1605373869.0,"I've been having symptoms for two days and it was really bad this morning. Did the AZO stick test and it came up with very positive (we're taking magenta/purple) for leukocytes and negative/trace for nitrites. Meaning there was inflammation but no signs of a classic E. coli caused UTI.

I asked a couple friends for opinions bc this is my first time feeling this way. They laughed when I said I was going to my doctor. They said it would go away on it's own with drinking a lot of water and cranberry juice.

I went to the dr. today and my urine sample I gave showed moderate levels of leukocytes, no nitrites, some blood, and some bacteria present. So I'm now taking antibiotics because even though *some* bacteria were present, the UTI could start up again from the same infection and could be even more severe.

Sure, many people can have UTIs go away on their own. But there is always a chance it could spread to infect the kidneys and/or cause septicemia. There is also a chance it could be an STI (all negatives for me). The point is, go see a doctor.

**tl;dr: take calcium and vitamin d for menstrual symptoms**

I was never one to really get PMS symptoms. Maybe a little breast tenderness and soft stools on the first day, cramping on the first day but nothing Advil couldnt fix. Consistent, predictable periods

Last year my body went completely haywire. I don't even know how to begin explaining to you how sick I felt, like clockwork at ovulation, my body and my mind completely fell apart. It felt like no system was left untouched. I felt so bad I truly genuinely thought I was dying for months

All of the symptoms I experienced (many were just related to a vitamin deficiency and not my menstrual cycle specifically)

* gallbladder problems
* kidney problems
* heartburn, stomach acid washing back into my lungs
* chronic, random hives
* allergic reactions to things I had never reacted to before
* fevers
* diarrhea, sometimes 15x a day during ovulation
* constipation
* extreme loss of appetite. nausea/vomiting/gagging upon putting anything in my mouth
* muscle weakness and this really gross general body sensation I can only describe as 'puke colored and gooey'
* insane, out-of-control, burning up jet fuel kind of anxiety. beyond anything ive experienced before and ive lived with anxiety and anxiety attacks for years
* jet fueled insomnia
* extreme fatigue
* hallucinations
* vision problems, worse visual snow and sometimes feeling like I was processing my visual field like it was a simulation or something
* feeling like my eyes were bugging out of my head
* rapid accelerations or deceleration in BPM
* postural hypotension
* a burning sensation all over my body/neuropathy
* all kinds of different rashes
* blood pooling in my extremities when standing
* fainting
* headaches
* sudden, severe mood swings. feeling ok one minute and within minutes sinking into the deepest, most suicidal, hopeless depression I've ever experienced
* irregular periods
* periods that were lighter/thinner than normal but stretched over a longer period of time
* PAINFUL AWFUL cramps. like sweating, fetal position, cant get off the bathroom floor all week cramps
* chronic pelvic and low back pain
* a sensation of growing pains in my bones that I've actually had since I was 17 but no doctor knew anything about. but during this whole thing I realized they also happen around ovulation

It took a few months but I started to realize certain, and the most severe, symptoms occurred at ovulation, and a bit into the luteal phase but they seemed to level out some before my period. During ovulation I felt like my body was burning up jet fuel and then after I crashed and just felt really tired, weak and sluggish for a few days.

I saw a family doctor, 2 gastroenterologists, countless urgent care docs, a cardiologist, and finally, when I realized my symptoms were cyclical, 2 endocrinologists.

The first endocrinologists ran a bunch of tests and basically just found I was really low in vitamin D. 'Whatever' I thought ""Everyone's deficient in vitamin D'. So she gave me some mega doses of vitamin D for 2 weeks and then a maintenance dose. I felt better so, so quickly. Even symptoms I had for years but didn't think were necessarily linked, like the pelvic pain and bone pain and hives/new allergies, went away. My mental health, which I've struggled with since I was 12 when I saw my first therapist, has improved dramatically.

I could not believe that the most sick I've felt in my life was due to a single nutritional deficiency. At my follow up I tried to ask for an explanation; about the connections between vitamin D and the menstrual cycle, and my doctor didn't really know, she just knew a lack of vitamin D could make you feel really bad.

That wasn't good enough for me. I hated that no doctor could really tell me *why* I was going to hell and back every month so I wasn't feeling confident it couldn't happen again. I started doing my own research (which, tbh, I'm very good at. I'm a recovering hypochondriac and my doctors who know me well often encourage me to consider med school. It's hard for me to praise myself, but I am good at this stuff.) Basically I found some, but not a ton, of research basically linking vitamin D, calcium, the parathyroid glands and the menstrual cycle. I didn't know if the relative lack of research was just because the science was still in its infancy, if the medical community just doesn't care about women's issues enough, or if it was bad science.

But in all of these papers I check the authors and if they're still working. One of them luckily, is working and coincidentally, was also in a hospital system I was previously a part of (Mount Sinai). I scheduled an appointment with her and I'm so glad I did. She was the first doctor who could finally, *finally* tell me what was going on with my body because PMS is what she's spent her career studying.

We all know calcium and estrogen are linked right? We know post menopausal women are at increased risk for osteoporosis. We also know women who experienced PMS/PMDD are more likely to have osteoporosis. Why? Estrogen helps the body absorb calcium. We also know vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption. Without enough vitamin D, your body can't get enough calcium. After a long time without vitamin D, your body will start leeching calcium from your bones in an effort to maintain homeostasis. Calcium isn't just an essential nutrient for bones, it's also an electrolyte. Electrolytes regulate nerve and muscle function as well as balance water and acid.

During ovulation when estrogen peaks, the parathyroid glands along with estrogen leech calcium from the bones because they body isn't able to get it anywhere else, causing bone weakening and a sudden surge in calcium in the blood stream in a condition called hypercaleceima. Though hypercalecemia caused by vitamin d deficiency are usually less severe than hypercalecemia caused by parathyroid tumors. When estrogen drops, so too does calcium in the bloodstream, leading to hypocalecemia

Electrolyte imbalances are serious; my mom almost died from one. At a low level they're not critical, but they're going to make you feel sick -- possibly monthly. If the nerves in all of your organs aren't being regulated properly by proper electrolyte balance, of course that's going to cause some issues. Further, dysregulated muscles and nerves are going to cause PAIN, including more painful cramps then necessary

Again, it's amazing to me that the most sick I've felt could be so easily cured with some supplements. But calcium isn't just a mineral, its an electrolyte. And vitamin d isn't really a vitamin (since we can make it ourselves), it's a pre-hormone and acts more like a steroid in the body. Neither me or my doctor know why my symptoms got so severe all of a sudden, but we think COVID probably had a hand in that. I also was taking omeprazole, a strong antacid, for a few months when I was first having my GI symptoms. With less stomach acid, my body was less able to break down food and get the necessary nutrients out of it, so I was exasperating my problem further.

Again, I know this is long but I hope the few of you that read the whole thing feel empowered to take control of your menstrual cycle; that you don't have to suffer this way every month. I can confidently say, at least for me, I am no longer experiencing any of the symptoms above. And they were resolved so so quickly. I've also been taking vitamin B12 and a B complex vitamin. Which brings me to my other point; **this probably isn't going to be a solution for you if you're not deficient in these vitamins.** But if you live in an industrialized country, if you have darker skin, if you wear sunscreen religiously, or if you don't go outside much, there's a good chance youre deficient in D. And if you don't really eat meat, and aren't diligent about replacing meat-specific nutrients, you're probably low in B12.

Ok, I'm getting off my soap box. I just really, really don't want anyone to have to suffer like I did especially when the solution is so easy, but also easily missed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/ln5slr/those_who_suffer_from_pms_pmdd_and_dysmenorrhea/,"those who suffer from PMS, PMDD and dysmenorrhea: READ THIS",,323,85,0.99,throwra05059

He was so amazing. He made sure we could get to clean bathrooms every few hours (I use a menstrual cup and it needs frequent changing on day one and two). I made us late a couple of times because of how long I needed in there, and he was patient and so chill about it. He also filled up my hot water bottle, and made me my raspberry leaf tea in the morning. Lots more, but those are the highlights.

The first day we met (March 2020), we talked about periods and birth control and natural birth delivery. Not sure how we got on those topics. Partially because I'm a health coach, but mostly because we were so comfortable talking to each other. I fell halfway in love with him the first day.

I am so open with him about my periods. Sometimes I ask that we put an important conversation on hold because I know I'm PMSing and emotional. Other times, he's changed plans for us because of the timing with my cycle.

It is even more special to me because I never had this growing up. I was raised in a family and culture where periods should be kept secret. I had such difficulty because I never understood what was happening to me and I couldn't discuss things openly. Even my mother was embarassed to talk about it, and got really upset at me when I started using tampons, and then later the cup.

md80u3,WomensHealth,1616705260.0,"Hi, everyone. I'm that girl that made a series of posts starting with being afraid that her ovaries were dead and leading into a battle with ovarian cancer (and sh*tty genes).

So...we had to struggle a bit to get me the scans I needed to see if the treatments were enough. It seems that my insurance company refused to acknowledge any type of scan as medically necessary, and didn't want to cover it at first.

Because of course checking to see whether or not a cancer patient still has a fast-growing cancer is unnecessary, right? That makes perfect sense.

My Oncologist was confused and called it completely ridiculous at how firm they were being about it, especially since I couldn't start my preventative treatment until I was deemed in remission, and they need scans to deem me in remission. However, after a few weeks we got approval for a CT scan. I got to learn that the texture of the barium smoothies is the main turnoff point (not the taste).

However, there was a bit of an issue with the IV. It appears that my last good arm-vein of the time decided to blow mid-scan...they tried to get me closer to my hands, but it was no use. In the end, we had to wait and see if the oral contrast was enough to get perfect imaging.

I went to see my oncologist this Tuesday, and I found out that they were clear enough and I am officially in remission! I know the doctors all said that my chances of death were really low, but the full weight of it hit me like a freight train; I'm going to live!!! 

I'm so happy...for the first time in months, I can sit here and not worry about cancer. My eyebrows are already back; very thin, but growing every day! My hair is slowly growing and its so soft now! Its almost to the point where my scalp is invisible. My eyelashes are starting to grow out. 

Now there is one more obstacle left; I need to go back and get the hysterectomy finished. My uterus and remaining ovary are apparently a big risk now, so...I can't keep them for very long. If my SO and I were in a position to have kids, we would consider holding off long enough to do that but we are years away from that, and we can't afford to wait that long. I hate it, but it is for the best... 

The doctor ordered Parp Inhibitors in hopes that they could help me in the long run with my er...sh*tty gene problem. The big issue is that these are pretty expensive...I will need to navigate juggling keeping my medical insurance with finding gainful employment because I can't afford the parp inhibitors 
out-of-pocket. A single month looks to be thousands of dollars, and I need them for 2 years. It is my hope that the BRCA1 mutation will be better controlled with these, however. 

Bottom line, I am free! I am getting to the point where I can figure out how to get back on track, and I am so, so happy! Tomorrow I will also be getting myself vaccinated for Covid; I spoke to my oncologist about it and I qualify for phase 1b in my state due to my body still recovering from the chemotherapy. I have already survived one Big C...I plan to take every step possible to make sure I don't have to deal with with the other.

EDIT: I forgot to mention this...we found my mother's cause of death.

It turned out to be Toxic Shock Syndrome...she had a laparoscopic procedure done a couple of weeks after my own surgery, and...it seems this was a belated complication. We were shocked; apparently it is incredibly rare to have a complication like that occur so long afterwards. It usually only happens within a a couple of weeks of the procedure. It had been so long since her procedure with no signs of it that when the symptoms hit, everybody assumed it was food poisoning...we can only hope that she was asleep when the worst of it hit, but...I know it wasn't a peaceful way to go.

As the title says, HPV has ruined my life. It has affected my work, my finances, my mental and physical well-being, and my relationship with my husband. 

Quick backstory, I was diagnosed with HPV last summer for the first time at 32. Never had an abnormal pap. It has been 3.5 years since my previous pap so I was only 6 months or so past when I should have had one. I had been having on and off post intercourse bleeding that prompted me to go. The HPV was a huge shock. I‚Äôve only been with my husband. However, we had split up the year before for nearly a year and he had a partner during that time. Who knows when I got HPV but throwing that in there. 

Pap was normal for cell changes. Doc said come back in a year. Didn‚Äôt feel right so I asked for colposcopy. She did one and said she saw nothing to biopsy and come back in a year. Still didn‚Äôt feel right. Got a second opinion and he said my cervix lit up with cell changes in one large spot. Ended up with CIN 2 (precancer level 2 out of 3). Was spiraling during this time. Ended up being diagnosed with illness anxiety disorder and even residual PTSD from this. New doctor said not to worry, LEEP would fix it and I‚Äôd be fine. 

Doc does LEEP and during discovers a spot of vaginal dysplasia (VAIN). VAIN is incredibly rare at around .02 per 100,000 and most of that very small amount is 60 or over. I‚Äôm early 30s. Shocked yet? I sure was. 

Doctor was super casual, biopsy confirmed grade 1 VAIN, doc said he removed it via excision because he was already in there. 

I wanted to know my strain so paid extra to rule out 16/18/45 because those cause the majority of HPV cancers by a long shot. Negative for those strains.  Went ahead and did anal test even though I didn‚Äôt think I would have it because I‚Äôve never had anal intercourse. Guess what? Positive anally too. Now I have to get a test done to check for anal dysplasia. 

I‚Äôve been having random bouts of dryness, itching, burning. My vulva simply looks unhealthy. Now I‚Äôm worried I could have vulvar dysplasia from HPV too. I can rarely have sex with my husband anymore.  I‚Äôll be checking more into that at my next check up in March. 

I have my 6 month check up in 2 months and they will test if I‚Äôve cleared the HPV and will also check to be sure no cell changes have recurred. Around 60 percent of people clear HPV at 6 months after LEEP.  I have no confidence it will be cleared due to having shit luck so far and the fact the infection is confirmed to be in 3 places. It is ravaging my body. 

I‚Äôm spending HUNDREDS a month in supplements, vitamins, etc to try to clear this. 

Why is my body not doing it‚Äôs job? Why is it in so many places? Why am I having so many issues without even having the worst stains? 

Most importantly, WHY didn‚Äôt my gynecologists EVER offer the vaccines? NEVER. I was having PAPS to check for cervical cancer but never offered the vaccine for the thing that causes virtually all cervical cancers. I feel FAILED. It‚Äôs suggested up to 26. 

Please please please get your children vaccinated for HPV. Boys and girls. They all need it.

If you are in your 20s, get it. Even if you have had a strain of it, you likely haven‚Äôt had all of them and this will protect you from the others. 

They even changed it to where it‚Äôs good for even up to 45. 

Yes, this is an EXTREMELY common infection. 80 percent of people will have it at some point. 90 percent will clear without an issue. There is NO reason to be in the 10 percent like me who didn‚Äôt clear and now have life changing issues when there is a vaccine to practically take the chance of it away. 

I‚Äôm not here to cause panic. I‚Äôm here to share why it‚Äôs so important and God knows I wish I had someone telling me how important it truly is. 

I truly hope that in another 20 or how many ever years that high risk HPV infection is unheard of.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/19aqf9b/hpv_has_ruined_my_life/,HPV has ruined my life.,,317,131,0.96,Ok-Training-9414
zh91lo,Healthyhooha,1670620717.0,"I have posted here before looking for answer to why I kept having papercut like tears constantly on my vulva and around my vagina....and

OH MY GOD! I  just got done with an appointment with a new Gynecologist today. I just finished crying in my car on my whole commute to work. Why? Because I FINALLY know why I have had vulvar atrophy (tearing) for the last freaking 4 YEARS. I was biopsied, did blood work, pap smears, STD testing, ect. Nothing came back with an answer as my estrogen levels were fine, bloodwork was good, and everything was negative on my tests! I was in pain, my sex life was non-existent due to tearing fears, I was getting angry and depressed, damn, I couldn‚Äôt even wipe without getting a tear! It has been brutal. I walked in slightly hopeful, but still expecting to be disappointed. I had done my research and I was almost positive by this point that the issue was being caused by my birth control but my other doctors did not think so.

I get in and talk with the doctor and I tell her that I don‚Äôt want to undermine her or any of my doctors but I 110% think it is my birth control causing I but that my doctors do not agree. She takes a moment looking at my chart and then asks me if I know how birth control works. I think it is weird, but I answer her what I have always been told. It stops ovulation and thickens uterine lining to keep the sperm from being able to fertilize an egg. She said yes but then also explained about hormones and how they work and confirmed it for me: ‚ÄúYour low dose birth control is messing up your estrogen causing the skin to be thin and delicate. Almost like a woman in menopause.‚Äù That is what I have read and come to in all of my research in my time and none of my other doctors thought it was possible, BUT IT WAS AND IT IS. I was so relieved the more she told me about it and explained it and I was like omg‚Ä¶. She said that the low dose is terrible and she tries to never put her patients on that and prefers other methods that she feels are better and don‚Äôt mess with the estrogen and progestogen levels as much. The birth control I have been on for over 9 years, Lo loestrinfe, she said yes it low dose and she does not like that pill specifically. She understands why I was put on it as any other doses of estrogen/progesterone in birth control made me severely homicidal or severely feeling like un-alieving myself. She herself, does not prescribe and tries everything she can to not prescribe it unless it is a last ditch effort. Basically, it was only giving me back 10mg of estrogen and the normal amount is 30mg or so?  Forgive me for doing my best to try and regurgitate everything she said. It was hours ago and crying then going into work has my brain scrambled.

SO ANYWAY, my body was basically getting deprived of estrogen causing the skin to thin and making my body feel like it was in menopause on my vulvar skin. I was literally about to cry like OMG I KNEW IT WAS SOMETHING WITH MY BIRTH CONTROL!!! THEN she also told me that the clobetasol cream/ointment (I used both) that I had been told to use for the last year and a half was making the issue WORSE! I had also tried Estrogen cream but I was only put on it for 2 weeks, which she said it might have helped but I needed to be on it MUCH longer than that. She did not want to give me more pills and offered an IUD as a solution as I do not want kids but also, due to my autoimmune disease, I would have an extremely high risk pregnancy. I want to get sterilized but my insurance will not cover the procedure I want and they are unable to deem it as medically necessary unless I have past medical history, but even then they would need to remove my ovaries too. The doctor was a little hesitant about that part (removing ovaries), but preferred a bislap over tubal ligation due to risks (ectopic pregnancy and ovarian cancer). But my stupid insurance will cover ligation but not the other. She agreed with me when I mentioned Texas does not care about women.

I also just really want to put this in there because I appreciate it and loved this appointment. She did not shame or try to talk to me into having kids. No ‚Äúbingo‚Äùing as we say in my child-free group. She was 100% supportive of my choice in wanting to be child-free and sterilized. Not only that, she also noted that my stress could be contributing to my issues and asked if I saw a therapist. I said I did years ago for my extreme anxiety and depression until I could no longer afford it. My therapist was great and she armed me with the tools to help continue my recovery journey. She said that it must have been and is really hard for me being so young and dealing with not one, but two autoimmune diseases on top of all this issues with my vulva, as well as any other stressors in my life. I don‚Äôt know, but that just really hit me right in the heart that she was so empathetic about it and as genuinely concerned for my physical, emotional, and mental health. It has been hard with my autoimmune diseases as well as my vulva issues, and to have someone else see and acknowledge that and care just meant so much to me. Literally bawled to my boyfriend the whole drive to work (25 minutes lol). He thought that the doctor was mean to me or something LOL.
 
So yeah, I FINALLY have an answer and I implore you, all of you, who have had this issue or dealing with this issue. NEVER stop fighting for an answer, you don‚Äôt have to suffer. I truly hope every one of you that has this issue, a similar issues, or another issue all together, find someone: a nurse practitioner, a doctor, any qualified medical specialist who will listen to you and do what this doctor did for me. I am so eternally grateful that I finally have an answer and am now working on a solution.

 

TLDR: My low dose birth control has been causing my tearing by depriving my body of estrogen causing the skin to be very thin and fragile. She was kind and did not bingo me for not wanting children and offered solutions. She also explained in depth why birth control was the issue and solutions and what they all are and what might work best for me. She also laid out a treatment plan for me and showed empathy for my autoimmune disease struggles.

Thanks for reading.


***EDIT UPDATE****

So I got a Kyleena IUD placed because I don't ever want to be pregnant and because my periods suck without BC. I got it placed in Feb. 2023, and I am happy to report I have not had tearing since maybe Sept./Oct. 2023!!! It was still noticeable for awhile after I got my IUD but it gradually slowed down and stopped. Tearing now only occurs if I am extremely rough or am wiping so much that my vulva is super dry and irritated. I did get a super back yeast infection combined with I think they said BV(?) a few weeks after my IUD insertion. It was terrible but I used witch hazel wipes during that time and god it felt like heaven. It really helped soothe the area. After that I have not had any tears so I don't know if that was a blessing in disguise.

So I am happy to report my tearing was caused my hormone imbalance from my low dose BC depriving me of estrogen. My estrogen levels showed up normal on tests but was the issue all alone. I got a Kyleena IUD. After a few months and a terrible yeast infection and BV at the same time, I no longer have had any tears since then. 

I hope each and everyone of you that comes across my post with the same issue are able to find a solution!

mmiiev,Healthyhooha,1617850737.0,"I'll start this by saying I quite like Tiktok for how fun it is and how catered the feed is. However, I got SO heated watching a seemingly young woman touting the advantages of vaginal ""moisturizing"" flavored(!!) suppositories. I haven't seen any gynecologists debunking them yet, and I tried looking for the ingredients on their **ETSY** shop but since they went viral the company is in the process of moving to their own platform. Multiple people said they have coconut oil in them, which isn't *necessarily* bad in itself, but I'm highly suspicious of whatever flavoring agents are in there. The video's creator specifically said the peach flavor was her boyfriend's favorite. I saw some people saying stevia was in them. So many of the comments were people asking whether they'd get BV/UTIs/yeast infections from using them, and the creator often responded saying they were perfectly safe! I immediately thought of y'all and this sub, because this is some of the best crowd-sourced vaginal health info on the web.

I find content like this so infuriating because:

1) a lot of the viewers are impressionable young people who are easily influenced by hype

2) there is no fact-checking or scientific basis for any of this product's claims, plus it was being sold on Etsy of all places

3) this seems to prey on patriarchal notions of how gross vaginas are and that they need to be altered for sex/oral sex to be enjoyable (specifically for men)

4) unless they were explicitly for lubrication, the vagina does not need to be moisturized; those aren't the same thing imo

This is very concerning because products going viral on Tiktok have definite real-world ramifications and it happens very quickly. Has anyone else seen this video?

14enie2,Healthyhooha,1687295804.0,"TLDR; Years of excessive yellow smelly discharge, constant moisture down south. Most of the moisture was actually sweat, which caused my healthy bacteria to overgrow, hence the excess discharge. Using antiperspirant wipes in my area groin cured me!

&#x200B;

So,

I've had excessive, yellow, smelly discharge for going on 4 years, and just constant uncomfortable moisture in my groin. Every test just kept coming back normal. Antibiotics used to work to get rid of it, but it would always come back after my period. 

I've been to multiple gynecologists over the years, done a bunch of Juno Bio tests, and tried everything, but nothing helped. (UNTIL NOW THAT IS :D)

&#x200B;

For some reason, I had thought the excessive moisture in my groin was from the excess discharge. I eventually discovered it's actually my excessive sweat levels, which makes sense since I have hyperhidrosis in pretty much every other part of my body lol. I'm talking dripping, immediately after my showers, 24/7.

I finally had enough of the sweat, and went to a dermatologist, who gave me ultra strong antiperspirant wipes to use on my groin. I figured if I was going to have the stupid discharge forever, at least the rest of the area could be dry lol.

Now, usually after I get my period, the blood just turns into the profuse yellow glop that I constantly had to deal with. When I used these wipes though, I did get the yellow discharge for about five days after my period, BUT GUYS, at about that fifth day mark, it slowly faded to a clear, regular amount of discharge. 

So by day 5 after my period now, it's just normal levels of clear, non-smelly, normal discharge!!! (and when I say normal, I mean my normal that I had before all this started. I know everyone's 'normal' might be different). It probably just takes a few days now for my vagina to get back to the normal flora after a period.

I switched to different antiperspirant wipes since I didn't like the dermatologist ones, but I'm happy to say, this has been working for two periods now, so I think I finally found my cure!

Now is it safe to be using antiperspirants in the groin? I have no idea. But even if it isn't, this is such a major quality of life improvement for me, it's a tradeoff I'm willing to make. The wipes the dermatologist gave me were Qbrexza, and the ones I use now are the Duradry ones for hands and feet.

&#x200B;

So I dug out the ol' reddit account to post this here, just in case someone out there might be having the same problem as me. I know how much it sucks, so hopefully this helps someone <3

I told her I was tired of how much this affects my daily life, and she said ‚Äúthere isn‚Äôt necessarily something wrong just because it‚Äôs an inconvenience to you‚Äù. I had to keep myself from crying during the appointment because I was so frustrated with the lack of acknowledgment for my issues. I‚Äôve done my fair share of research, and I suspect that I have endometriosis (but of course, it could be some issue as simple as hormone irregularities) I‚Äôm changing doctors as soon as my new insurance kicks in. 

Every doctor I‚Äôve gone to for this issue has either been condescending or impatient with my reason for coming in, like I‚Äôm a waste of their time. It makes me feel irrational. It makes me feel like I‚Äôm being overly dramatic or I‚Äôm exaggerating my issues. I just want one doctor to say ‚Äúyes, I hear you, let‚Äôs get you tested and rule out any possible causes for these issues‚Äù. And after that, if my symptoms really are just my normal, then I‚Äôll accept that. I‚Äôm just sick of not knowing whether there is actually something wrong with me or not.

Anyway, who else is sick and tired of this shit?

1axd8uu,Healthyhooha,1708625452.0,"Hey everyone,

this is a throwaway account as I am super confused, hurt and embarrassed by all this. Sorry if it is long but I am still reeling.

I recently found out I was pregnant and went to my OBGyn who I hadn't seen in many years (used to see one closer to work but she closed down a while ago so I went back to the doc I saw from 2004-2010ish). This man has been great in the past and supported me through an abortion when I was 17, I had zero reasons to doubt his medical expertise. He is very friendly and professional.

So yesterday he did my first ultra sound, confirmed my pregnancy (which had me cry in the chair as I watched my kid's heart beat) and then tells me that I have an infection down there that needs to be treated with antibiotics. No biggie so far.

Then he proceeds to ask me how exclusive hubby and I are. I tell him we've been together for a decade and very exclusive, and he tells me that the infection I have is sexually transmittable and in 99% of cases through sex. Like, it's extremely unlikely he or I picked it up elsewhere. He asks me if I ever cheated. I stare at him in disbelief and say no, then tell him that I really, really don't think hubby would cheat on me. 

He tells me to go home and confront him. Literally said ""Look him in the eye, if he's lying he won't be able to hold eye contact"". Then tells me he's sure we can work it out and to bring him to the next checkup next week. Asks me to tell hubby he needs to pick up antibiotics for himself at his own GP. I leave shellshocked.

Now, I confront hubby, we cry and argue, I think he cheated on me, he swears he didn't so he thinks I cheated on him. It's a whole mess. Through all that I don't even remember what the doc said I have, so I email the practice and ask. This morning they reply and tell me it's Gardnarella. I google it and nearly puke because it is NOT and STD??? And we fought over absolutely nothing on the day I brought home our first ultrasound pic.

Now I'm starting to question my sanity here. Can I go back to this doctor? Should I confront him? Should I confront him and then change docs? The OBGyn situation in my city is terrible, I've tried a bunch over the past years and they treat their patients like absolute crap. I am so confused why he said this, possibly blowing up my marriage while I'm 6 weeks pregnant over literally nothing??? 

I'm grateful for any input at this point. The internet tells me G. vag. is NOT an STD and is usually just an imbalance in the vagina. What would you guys do, or is there a better subreddit you could refer me to if this isn't the right place to ask?

The doctor asked if he could have another doctor view the procedure, I am not shy so I said yes. 

The thing is this made the whole thing last 3 times long at least and I wish I had said no. He walked her through a very rough examination. He inserted the inserter into my cervix as I coughed and left it in there as he pointed things out and explained things to the viewing doctor. I was struggling to breathe through the pain. I can take a quick pain but this was an unnecessary minute of leaving it in, it fucking hurt. I cried and the health care assistant holding my hand looked so uncomfortable like she knew it shouldn‚Äôt be like this. He did not take notice of my discomfort. The process itself turned me from a patient/person into a demonstration dummy. The way he spoke about me made me so uncomfortable in a really vulnerable time and I still find it upsetting to recall and I can recall it vividly. This was years ago and I don‚Äôt remember his name so I can‚Äôt complain. 

My partner wasn‚Äôt allowed to be the one holding my hand but said he could hear me being in pain on the other side of the curtain and said I was white as a sheet and shaking when I came out.

hfm02e,Healthyhooha,1593091376.0,"I have been living with my friend for a few months now, and I believe she has a vaginal infection. The smell goes beyond that familiar musk you might get after a workout; it is one of the worst things I have ever smelled, and permeates every inch of the house. The bathroom where her towel is and the couch are soaked in it, and it sticks around after she leaves. I no longer work out with her as the smell is overpowering. When she wears dresses, and sits with her legs open, it is unavoidable, but if she wears jeans it's less noticeable. It doesn't smell like any infection I have ever had, or like a yeast infection, and frankly, it is so violent, I wonder how she doesn't smell it herself.

Recently a guest for dinner took me aside and asked me how I wasn't smelling the rotting garbage smell. Until this point, I had blamed it on our close living quarters, and being sensitve, but now I am a) concerned she has an infection and b) worried people will talk about her or avoid her. 

She has never been sexually active, and is extremely body conscious to the point where I have never seen her, in 18 years, in less than shorts and a tee shirt. She doesn't like going to the doctor (I suggested getting a pap smear just for general health, but she won't go), and will only go if it's unavoidable. A mutual doctor friend once told her she was concerned my friend might have sleep apnea and my friend was so embarrassed, and angry, and called it an invasion of privacy. I  100% understand how not nice it will be to hear, so I'm looking for help from fellow hooha owners.

mvhysl,WomensHealth,1619018442.0,"I had surgery a few years ago and this still bothers me, so I need to ask for some outside opinions. Just some background; I'm a woman in my 20s who lives in Canada. The surgery was to correct a deviated septum and enlarged turbinates. I was told it went as planned, although I did have some problems with the results which I will get into later. These are the only two surgeries I have ever had.

&#x200B;

Given that I was having nasal surgery, with the exception of removing the leads from the machines they connect to your chest to monitor your heart rate and such I didn't expect they would have any reason to go below my neck. When I woke up everything was normal, obviously I had some pain but I was taken great care of by the nurses. I had to stay in the hospital overnight, and at one point I went to the bathroom and when I removed my underwear there was a creamy white substance in them. It was definitely not discharge. It reminded me a lot of what had come out before as remnants of a Canesten tablet I used when I had a yeast infection. I asked the nurse if she knew what it was or why it was happening. She said she would have to check and when she came back later she told me that when I got out of surgery but was still unconscious they put in a vaginal suppository to help reduce nausea when I woke up. I will never forget the look on her face when she said it, because it was kind of hushed and she didn't meet my eyes when she said it. I don't know if I am connecting things that aren't there but that makes me nervous. It has bothered me for the years since, but especially since I had a second surgery.

&#x200B;

After the original surgery I didn't recover well. I could barely breathe through my nose and was worse off than before, so I decided to have  a second surgery to correct it. I decided to see a different surgeon this time, so I got my referral and went to a different hospital in a different city. It was also a different district so they did not have immediate access to my original surgery's records. I had already put off that second surgery for three years and I was terrified going into it, not because of the surgery but because of what was on my underwear after the first one. I spoke to three different nurses (at original pre-op, a day-of one who sorted out my chart pre-surgery, and one who was actually in the surgery) and the anesthesiologist about my fears and told them that I absolutely did not want any suppositories of any kind during or after my surgery. I cried every time I had to explain it. They all seemed surprised when I told them what had happened, but one nurse was on the verge of tears with me and he told me he had never heard of that. He spoke with another nurse and they hadn't either. He said after that he doesn't think that should have ever happened and that I should get a copy of my medical records from the first surgery.

&#x200B;

I have thought about this all so much since. I'm so confused and upset by it. I wonder if I'm overreacting because I am a victim of sexual assault and haven't had any kind of sex other than that, so I know I'm very sensitive to these matters. Was what they did normal? Am I overreacting? If anyone can help me here, give me advice or relate your own story or anything I'd really appreciate it.

Edit: I just want to say thank you to everyone who has commented. I have read all of your responses and although some opinions or suggestions have been scary to read, I feel a sense of comfort in knowing that I‚Äôm not overreacting. I truly appreciate everyone who has taken the time to respond, share their story, or offer comfort.

jbop8j,Healthyhooha,1602772544.0,"Hooha friends, we have a problem. 

I NEED all of you to follow the rules when posting photos. But it's become clear that we need to do more to filter out surprising posts of genitalia and body fluids. This place truly is about normalizing good feminine hygiene, but that doesn't mean we should subject one another unexpectedly to graphic photos. 

As soon as I post this I plan on messaging some mods from some other subs that have some automatic filters in place to help fix this problem. I want the users of this sub to be able to solicit non-medical-but-friendly feedback on their issues  That's what we've been about from the start. 

I do apologize that it's gotten this bad to each and every one of you who has ever browsed this sub, hoping to find an answer to a question you have about your own body. 

Much love, 

peachikeene

EDIT #1 - To clarify, we do still want to be able to have our users post images if they feel the need to. Thing is, more often than not, these photos are showing 1000% NORMAL vaginas/vulvas. I've looked at them. I want the community to be able to get the reassurance they need to know they are normal. 

But we also HAVE to have a way to automatically filter them to the mod queue for approval before publishing (this is my ideal plan, and that's what I'm actively working on), or at least to mark them automatically NSFW (as mentioned below, which I've learned is how r/badwomensanatomy does it). My goal is to keep rule-breaking posts off everyone's feed in the first place until we as mods can make sure they follow the rules. If we don't address it in this matter, we will continue to have surprise genitalia and/or discharge on our feeds because right now, all we can do is rely on the reporting feature and by then, it's already happened. 

I will update again once I get the AutoMod up and running. I have already been in contact with the r/badwomensanatomy mods as well as within the r/AutoMod community to get solutions. I'm onto an answer at this very moment, and then will probably run a few test posts to see if it works. 

Thanks everyone for your patience.

EDIT #2 - I may have found a fix. Anyone willing to help me test it? Please DM me first.

EDIT #3 - it‚Äôs somewhat fixed. Ran a few test posts last night, some got through, most didn‚Äôt. I will keep tinkering with it over the weekend and will update again. 

I‚Äôm so thankful for the help I‚Äôve received so far. I plan to shout out everyone who‚Äôs either helped me with the AutoMod code or helped run a few test posts. I‚Äôm gonna try to reach out to the posters of NSFW photos in the past few weeks or so to update them of the changes and give them the opportunity to repost as well. I appreciate all the comments of support here too. Thanks everyone.

HOPEFULLY FINAL EDIT - I think we've done it, friends. 

Huge thanks to all that helped test, both users and fellow mods alike; and huge thanks to our friends at badwomensanatomy and the AutoMod subreddit for helping me with the AutoMod coding. Any posts with any sort of photo link, either direct or from an image-hosting site, will be automatically removed with an AutoMod comment telling them about the rule. They will be asked to review the rules and resubmit. This *should* eliminate all photos period in the main feed, and the mods will be able to see them in our mod queue and can approve them if they are regular photos, like a funny meme or something. Always down for the occasional funny meme around here. 

I hope this is a better fix than the previous system. I really think it's going to work great. Thank you to this awesome community for bringing it to our attention and being patient while we work it out.

i8x4lm,WomensHealth,1597312671.0,"I‚Äôm only making this post to serve other women who have questions, and concerns. This was just my experience.

After a week of my period being late I took a First Response pregnancy test that turned positive almost immediately. After talking to the father (who wanted absolutely no part and insulted me) I decided the best choice for me was to proceed with an abortion. 

I made an appointment with Planned Parenthood for the following week. When I arrived at Planned Parenthood everyone treated me with kindness and I felt very safe. (For me that‚Äôs very important because of my anxiety). I told the lady at the desk that I did not want to be on my mothers insurance and wanted it completely confidential. It took less then half an hour to get into the exam room. And within that time they got me covered by medicade so my appointment was free. As an 18 year old girl in the middle of a pandemic with no financial support this meant the world to me. My appointment took less then 2 hours from my arrival. They explained everything to me in detail, and what I should/shouldn‚Äôt expect. While I was at the clinic I had to urinate in a cup, get my blood drawn, had an ultrasound using a long camera tool they insert into your vagina to find out how far along your pregnancy is. It‚Äôs not painful but it is uncomfortable. It only lasts a few minutes. If they don‚Äôt have your blood type on file, or if your blood type is negative you‚Äôll need to get a shot. The shot is usually administered at the back of your hip and it doesn‚Äôt hurt bad at all. Planned Parenthood gives you a packet with their numbers and all the health information you‚Äôll need regarding your abortion and afterwards. 

The medication abortion is made up of two steps. When you are at the clinic they will give you the first pill. This is the pill that stops the pregnancy from growing. I didn‚Äôt experience any side affects of this medicine besides a little bit of diarrhea and slight stomach discomfort. Nothing too bad though. The second set of pills are taken at home. You and your doctor can decide if you‚Äôd rather take them orally or vaginally. There are 4 pills that you need to take. I chose vaginally, it‚Äôs not difficult you just stick them up there and lay in bed for 30 minutes - 1 hour.

I would say the cramping started about 1 hour and 30 minutes after I used the pills. I took Tylenol 30 minutes before using the pills. I highly recommend using your pain medicines that your doctor suggested to you. (DON‚ÄôT USE ANY THAT MAY THIN YOUR BLOOD). The cramping is painful. On a scale of 1-10 I would say the pain is a 7. It feels almost like you constantly have to use the bathroom or poop. Not long after my cramping started I started to feel sick and nauseous. I did end up throwing up, but I felt a lot better after I did so. The cramping lasted for about 6 hours. I did start to get chills as well. 

Nausea, Vomiting, Chills, Fever, Dizziness, and Headaches are all a part of going through the abortion unfortunately. All of these things should subside within 24 hours, if not please call your doctor. 

In terms of pain management, set alarms every 4 hours to remind yourself to take more pain medicine. Keep a trash can next to you, and make it easy to get to the bathroom. Drink water, slowly sip on your water. Use a heating pad or warm water bottle to help ease your cramps. Use a cold cloth to put on your head. Nobody else knew I was going through this and I went through it by myself. Until my younger sister got home and she took care of me. Having somebody there with you helps with the pain. Your best option is to try and sleep through it the most you can. I took a couple of melatonin and smoked a bowl. I woke up at 2am but my cramps are gone for the most part and I‚Äôm feeling almost 100% better. 

Please spare any judgement this was just to help other women understand the pain that they may have to go through. It‚Äôs not something I ever want to experience again. I didn‚Äôt feel very emotional as some women may because I knew this was the right choice for me. So I highly suggest if you can have someone there with you. Tell them you have a stomach bug or something so they can at least support you. 

Hope this helps someone‚ù§Ô∏è",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/i8x4lm/6_week_medical_abortion/,6 Week Medical Abortion.,,288,20,0.98,yllek_anon

Try changing your body soap and laundry soap to unscented and gentle products. I know it sounds crazy but hear me out. 

It all started with a little itching in my vulva area. I was exercising a lot and I assumed this was the cause. Then my anal area became irritated. I went to the doctor, I was tested for STD‚Äôs, everything came back negative. They told me everything was fine, that it would probably clear up on it‚Äôs own. 

And it did. Kind of. The intense itching would go away but then it‚Äôd come back. My entire vaginal area would be extremely dry, burning and itching. I would scratch until it became red and irritated. Same with the anal area. Vagisil would take the itch away for a minute and would come right back. The only thing that helped was cold water sitz baths with colloidal oatmeal. Then I started getting pimples on my vulva area. I went to the doctor again. 

They tested me again for STDs. All negative. This time they gave me antibiotics for BV. The burning and itching went away. But came right back. The pimples would come and go. Went back to the doctor, was tested for yeast but I had normal levels. I decided to try a Mobistat kit anyways. No results. Went to the doctor again and was given another round antibiotics for BV Same thing. 

FINALLY a very kind nurse suggested that maybe I was sensitive my laundry detergent. She explained that laundry detergent has harsh chemicals that some people are sensitive to. Sensitivity can develop at any time in life. I thought she was crazy. At this point I had been dealing with the symptoms for close to two years. But I was desperate. So on the way home I bought some free and clear, washed everything with it and there has been no turning back. My vagina is happy. The itching and burning has completely stopped. I use dove unscented in the shower. The pimples went away.

I have been struggling with BV for the last few months as I‚Äôve been on constant antibiotics for other issues. I have never thought I had a smell. I take probiotics, use boric acid, etc just like my gynecologist tells me to. I cannot BELIEVE how insecure finding 3 memes about ‚Äúwhen you pull down her panties and it smells like fish‚Äù in his camera roll would make me.

 I grew up with little money and parents that would not buy me basic things like deodorant, body wash, etc. so as an adult I‚Äôve always been super ‚Äúanal‚Äù abt smelling good and overall hygiene. Having reoccurring BV is something I am SO insecure about. These memes in his camera roll were literally all from the one night he went down on me for the first time in months and I‚Äôve been internally breaking down every time he wants to have sex now. 

How do I tell him this hurts me? He knows I saw ‚Äúother photos/screenshots‚Äù of things but I haven‚Äôt brought up the ‚Äùstinky cooch‚Äù memes bc I know that‚Äôs the one thing that I am actually in control of when it comes to the weird shit in his camera roll.

I‚Äôd plaster this all over my personal social medias because I‚Äôve been living a life of hell for 2 years. I started having unprotected sex with my husband 2 years ago. Before then, we weren‚Äôt married and we‚Äôre doing our best to avoid pregnancy. It was all good for the first few months and then my vagina went out of wack. It smelled like I had a rotting animal inside of me 24/7. 

I was afraid to go out in public. To be close to people. It was very embarrassed. Luckily my husband is a sweetheart and never made me feel bad about it . I went to the doctor and I was told I had BV. Took Metronidazole and it did nothing. But they kept giving me Metronidazole. I stopped trusting my doctor and went to Reddit. I was told to try boric acid. It worked wonders temporarily. I was able to go to the gym confidently and have a sex life again. But if I stopped boric acid for even a day BOOM, rotting dead animal smell coming from my crotch. 

So then I kept looking on Reddit. Someone said I might have mycoplasma genitalium. I begged my doctor for a test. I didn‚Äôt have m. genitalium instead I had m. hominis & ureaplasma. Yet again my doctor prescribed Metronidazole. I requested doxycycline. Reluctantly she ordered doxycycline. Then I asked my husband to take it as well. We both did 14 days. No sex, taking doxycycline. Avoiding everything it said to avoid. Tons of pro & prebiotics. We both tested negative 1 ,3& 6 months after. I‚Äôve been so scared to do anything to make it come back. We‚Äôve been having unprotected sex because we‚Äôre trying for a baby. I really didn‚Äôt want pregnancy PLUS a swampy, stinky cat. 

Usually during sex my vagina would give up and just permeate the air with this rotten smell even if it was fine prior. But we‚Äôre 6 months post doxycycline and I smell like a normal vagina. last night my husband preformed oral sex on me for the first time in 2 years. I cried because despite the fact that he was willing to do it even though I smelled so bad. I wouldn‚Äôt let him. Last night I felt confident enough to let him go for it. And he told me I tasted like water.

I just had to share with someone. I never told anyone close to me of my struggles but this infection really destroyed my self esteem. I wouldn‚Äôt go to the pool or beach. I stopped going to the gym. I would take the stairs. Any activity that would involve sweating or my legs being open, I‚Äôd avoid.

ygl9d2,WomensHealth,1667054169.0,"Last Sunday morning I woke up and whilst laying in bed noticed my stomach was swollen and it felt hard. I worried momentarily then decided it must be constipation or trapped wind and got up, took some senekot and gave it no more thought. The following day it starts hurting, wasn't going down but I was starting a new job the next day and decided to ignore it again.  The following morning on the day of my job, I was getting my 3.5 year old ready but the pain was so much worse, I couldn't stand up straight even but I was still arguing with my partner that it would be fine and I had to get to my new job.  An hour later I gave in and went to A&E.  I went through triage (UK) and after that I could stand straight again so messaged my partner saying I'd come home still convinced it was probably just a bad case of trapped wind but the triage nurse said that was unlikely.  

After 3 different doctors poked and prodded me I was transferred to the surgical assessment unit, by now I had a canula in with IV fluids, I had given 3 lots of urine samples and when they asked me if I'd gained any weight recently I said what a lot of women apparently say 'I avoid weighing scales'. After a bladder scan the nurse said audibly 'my god', my bladder was apparently incredibly full which was odd as I'd just been and given a sample and had no problem.  They said I needed a catheter put in after a CT scan.  Went for the CT scan and went through the unpleasant experience of having a catheter put in.  

After another hour or so I was told I was being transferred to the gynaecology ward and would be staying overnight.  Thankfully my new job was very understanding that I hadn't made it to notnonly my first day but likely the following day, I still didn't know what was wrong.

After an unpleasant night's sleep with a catheter and still hooked up to an IV the doctors came to do their round and I found out what was wrong.  I have a 17cm ovarian cyst, the fluid they found on the bladder scan was in fact the fluid in the cyst.

I was released from hospital on the Thursday morning and am now awaiting a date for open surgery to remove the cyst and at least one of my ovaries.

rzsfqs,Healthyhooha,1641737227.0,"Hey, so I‚Äôm sharing this because I rarely saw success stories when I looked for them on Reddit and it made me feel hopeless.

Disclaimer - obv we‚Äôre all different and my solution won‚Äôt necessarily be your solution.

My issues began in March 2020 when I was 27. I was (and still am) in a long term relationship and I‚Äôm confident he didn‚Äôt cheat. (Thank you to the person on Reddit who told me that he definitely cheated and definitely gave me ureaplasma‚Ä¶ super helpful)

My symptoms were very itchy vagina, clear discharge, occasional smell but not fishy, a raw infected feeling, occasional tingling like I had been stung by an insect on the labia area. Sex hurt for my boyfriend and my ph was about 6.5. Running and walking was painful and itchy. 

Initially I tested positive for BV, had treatment and things got better. It came back but I never tested positive for BV again and the treatment didn‚Äôt work. Doctors thought I had thrush so treated me for that but again nothing worked.

I did all the things google suggested - I avoided baths, wore cotton underwear, used hydromol instead of shower gel, and took probiotics. 

I gave up and accepted that this was my life until summer 2021 when I couldn‚Äôt cope anymore and it was affecting my life so much. I had more tests and the only thing that came up was strep b. The gp said that shouldn‚Äôt cause any issues but because I was so desperate they agreed to treat me. I wondered if I had aerobic vaginitis so the gp agreed to treat me for that with vaginal antibiotics, hydrocortisone, probiotics, sea buckthorn and vitamin d. This didn‚Äôt work. 

Finally I saw a specialist at a sexual health clinic in the uk. He said that I did not have aerobic vaginitis and that strep b was not the issue. He did a range of tests and concluded I had a combination issue of low lactobacilli and a skin irritation. He prescribed me lactic acid (relactagel) for 7 days and something called daktacort, which was miconazole nitrate and hydrocortisone, for 6 weeks. Oh my word, it worked! My symptoms used to get worse before my period (an utterly unbearable itch) and now it‚Äôs gone. I feel normal for the first time in 2 years. 

Reddit has many uses but on this subreddit so many people told me I had ureaplasma. In the uk they don‚Äôt test for it or regard it as a concern, so this unnecessarily stressed me out. 

I‚Äôve continued to take sea buckthorn and vitamin d but I have no idea if they helped. 

I hope someone can find comfort from me sharing my story. It was a horrible experience but there is hope.

EDIT: it's now 18 months later and the issue has still pretty much gone away. I notice it reccurs a little just before my period is due and seems to be linked to the more thick sticky cervical mucus. I'm nt sure that is about but I apply dactocort when that happens and I make sure I consume probiotics such as kefir.

Additional edit 2024 - I still get so many messages about this post so wanted to update. The problem mostly went away but I had the odd flair up before my period. Daktocort helped but I also purchased Biofemme V probiotics and I think they really helped me. I haven‚Äôt had any issues since taking these. I‚Äôm now pregnant and have been fine during pregnancy so I think there is a hormonal element to this too.

I know the title sounds extreme, but hear me out - some people might need to hear this. Growing up, I always used mild, unscented soap to rinse my labia, using my hand to guide water wherever it needed to go. I still use soap to this day, however, a few years ago when I started having sex, I decided to be more thorough and was horrified at how much buildup I found. Since then, I swear by these techniques:

1. Stretch your labia minora (does not apply to everyone), and rub it between your thumb and forefinger to remove dead skin, discharge, and sometimes even leftover toilet paper. You want to be gentle, but thorough enough to ""exfoliate"" and get all the buildup in the crevices. When I do this, I can actually feel the buildup sloughing off.

2. This only applies if you have a hooded clitoris. Basically, you want to lift up the hood and let water run over the clit to remove any dead skin pooled around it. This area might be really sensitive for you, and  I would advice against ""exfoliating"" in the same way you would your labia, although I do rub the hood itself and gently wipe the perimeter of my clit where it meets the hood. 

3. I find that I sometimes get discharge buildup right outside my vagina. So without going into the vaginal canal itself, I make sure to clean AROUND the vagina and always wipe and rinse any buildup in the indented region between my labia minora, especially next to my perineum which is the indented portion that gets the most discharge buildup.


I have never had any vaginal health issues using these cleaning methods, since the cleaning occurs exclusively outside of the vaginal canal. I know that a lot of this probably isn't revolutionary, but I genuinely didn't know about this stuff until fairly recently and hope that this helps someone out.

176w56b,Healthyhooha,1697194970.0,"So, I'll try to keep it short and I'm posting this because it might be helpful for others. 

I started having thrush since I met my boyfriend 2 years ago. We went through multiple treatments, we both took antifungals, I was on one for 6 months, yada yada blah blah. Ureaplasma was suspected and it showed up then it was treated, tested, long clean for a looong time, still having thrush regularly. 

I was watching all aspects of my hygiene and diet. Cotton underwear and commando as much as possible, no low sugar, you name it. Full screening, tests, nothing but pesky candida that would go away and come back. 

After 6 months of medication everything was alright and then of course it started again. Devastating. 

So we were trying to find the reason it keeps happening and I've found out that my boyfriend washes his dick with SOAP before each time we have sex! Of course soap isn't rinsed off properly in majority of those cases and we have sex every day and sometimes twice a day! 

He kept disturbing my vaginal balance with a fucking soap for 2 years!!! ü§£ and he doubled down on it at some point as well because he thought that maybe he's not keeping himself squeaky clean lol i couldn't believe my ears. 

Two years of me going nuts trying to figure out why I'm having non stop thrush when i never had it before and it turns out that it's him and his desire to be as hygienic as possible. The thing is when we had sex 2 days ago as soon as his dick went in i felt burning sensation and now i know that it was badly rinsed out soap (that is also ultra heavily scented and I use it only for hands, my shower gel is always fragrance free). 

I love him but I wanted to kill him at the same time. No more soap for his dick. 

So this is something to keep in mind, ask your partners with dicks if they're soaping before having sex with you. 

Peace out ‚úåÔ∏è

UPDATE: today is November 1 and I happily inform everyone that I haven't had a single thrush episode since we figured this out. No more soap bar on his or my fingers, his penis or our toys. Only shower gel while taking a shower making sure it's rinsed off the external parts of the labia and penis (sometimes twice a day because we live in a hot climate) and plain water for freshening up in between. We use same sensitive shower gel to wash hands now as well. I ordered femenine wash gel and will use it for both hands and shower but so far just getting rid of a soap bar worked!!!

For those seeking feedback on their vulva with photos, the post MUST 1. Be marked NSFW. 2. The photo itself cannot be in the post. It must be linked to a host site. 3. Anyone posting this type of photo MUST be over 18.

Other photos, such as the odd funny meme or whatever, are fine.

I'm looking into verifying users and post flair to see how that could help us out. Thanks for your patience, we will update you when we get things ironed out. Thanks everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

Hey HoohaHavers!

Recently, we've been getting reports on most photos that are posted of vulvas/vaginas. The mods were on the fence about this for awhile, but for now we've decided to take down any current posts with NSFW photos attached, even if they're linked or marked NSFW. Going forward, photo submissions need to be cleared through the mods first. One of main concerns on our end is that there's not an easy to verify that the submitters are over the age of 18. Another personal concern I have is that truly, if you have a suspicious lesion or bump on your vulvar area, posting it here has very limited value. You might get some anecdotal responses from others that have had something similar, but from the very beginning we said that this sub is NOT an substitute for medical advice - even if many of us mods have a medical background. You're better off going in person to a clinic or OBGYN office to have it evaluated IRL - in a context where they can examine it, culture it, swab it, order medications, etc. to actually fix/address your problem. I know going to a clinic or doctor's office can be stressful or difficult or embarrassing, but it's still so important that if you can at all, try to get regular checkups and make appointments if you have problems. The healthcare workers you encounter have literally all seen hundreds of patients and your issue is often more common and treatable than you might think.

Thanks to everyone here for making this such a supportive community!

ehehr8,Healthyhooha,1577667020.0,"Research for a cure for herpes/cold sores is being conducted at the Fred Hutch Centre (FHC) for cancer research by Dr Jerome (M.D., Ph.D.) and his team. The majority of research done in this field focuses on vaccines while this research is aiming to find a cure. This research uses gene editing as a potential cure. While you have probably heard of CRISPR, Dr. Keith Jerome is using a different gene editor called meganucleases. This research is going incredibly well and I would like to spread the word about it to show support for the research being done.

Earlier this year Dr. Jerome explained in a presentation how his team have been able to target the latent HSV virus in two different places, as to cause them to completely unravel and disintegrate using gene editing. Just one injection of the meganuclease gene editors, was able to destroy up to 50% of latent HSV1 in mice in trigeminal nerve ganglia and up to 90% in the superior cervical ganglia. This disintegration of the latent virus greatly decreased replication of the remaining virus. Simply put, this was a partial cure--at least in mice. No off-target edits or other harmful effects were detected. The lab is now moving on to testing in guinea pigs which is deemed to be the gold-standard for pre human testing for herpes. Discussions with FHCs philanthropy manager confirmed that the lab is working towards a cure for both HSV-1 and HSV-2.

A peer reviewed paper is due to come out for this research in early 2020.

Dr. Jerome gave a video update of the HSV cure. He even gave our community a shout out, noting the fundraiser. You can watch the video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk5EO6RerCk&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk5EO6RerCk&feature=youtu.be)

In 2012 the World Health Organisation estimated that 3.7 billion people under age 50 (67%) have HSV-1 infection globally and an estimated 417 million people aged 15-49 (11%) worldwide have HSV-2 infection. Even if you do not have herpes/cold sores yourself you will know someone who does. A cure or even a vaccine would benefit billions of people.

Fundraiser: 

This research is currently partially funded by NIH but this fundraiser has greatly helped Dr Jerome to continue his work. The fundraiser was set up in late 2018 to help support Dr. Jerome's research at the Fred Hutch centre and has managed to reach $50,000 in donations in less than a year! This is incredible and has allowed Dr Jerome‚Äôs team to begin guinea pig testing (the gold standard, pre-human test) roughly a year ahead of schedule.

Let me say that again, $50,000 in donations in less than a year!

If you wish to help support his research through the fundraiser the link is here: [http://engage.fredhutch.org/site/TR?px=1709211&fr\_id=1574&pg=personal](http://engage.fredhutch.org/site/TR?px=1709211&fr_id=1574&pg=personal)

If you are able to give, even a small amount it would immensely help the progress towards a cure. Seeing the number of people donating also helps, as it shows those doing research or funding research for a cure or vaccine, the amount of people who would like progress to be made towards a cure for herpes. Simply supporting this research, along with other companies research with vaccines, through sharing and liking/up voting posts will help this cause. This is a way for our voices to be heard.

TL;DR: There's a very promising herpes cure being developed using gene editing at the Fred Hutch Centre for cancer research.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/ehehr8/research_for_a_cure_for_herpescold_sores_this/,"Research for a cure for herpes/cold sores!

12lbc4w,Periods,1681428765.0,"y‚Äôall‚Ä¶ let me begin with: everything is fine now! 

today is 4/13/23. on 12/18/22, i thought i may have lost a tampon inside of me. i called my gyno‚Äôs physician on call and essentially was told that this wasn‚Äôt possible‚Ä¶ i looked for it myself for 15 min and could not find anything. i ultimately decided that i had in fact removed the tampon before my shower and just didn‚Äôt remember. i put in another afterwards..

3/21 was the last day of my last cycle. i noticed a horrible smell i‚Äôve never had before. i assumed BV, went to urgent care, got put on antibiotics for 7 days. i even did STD testing (neg). smell was still there after meds, so i asked for a gel suppository med instead. i finished those and smell subsided for 2ish days. 

yesterday 4/12 i started my current cycle and i was using tampons as i usually do. i noticed that the smell was particularly foul.. like rotten flesh. 

some time passed and i eventually self diagnosed with PID, bought some pads instead (read that tampons + PID is a bad idea) went back and forth for hours about if i should go to the ER or wait to see my doctor because i thought i had a gnarly infection in my uterus. i woke up at 12am with a terrible feeling in my gut so i went to the ER. 

took vitals, had blood drawn, and a pelvic exam. upon exam, the doctor FOUND THE TAMPON. it was removed. it was in there for nearly 4 months. the smell in that exam room was beyond atrocious. i was mortified.

i am incredibly lucky that i did not die of TSS or septic shock. all of my blood work came back clear and normal, no infection. i literally could have died. i‚Äôve promised myself to never use another tampon because this experience scarred me and apparently my memory can‚Äôt be trusted. 

PLEASE‚Ä¶. be careful. i‚Äôve been using tampons exclusively for 10yrs and this is the first time this has happened to me. it was so scary.

jn65mt,Periods,1604388754.0,"So, I‚Äôm suffering from severe dysmenorrhea. My period has always been painful but the past few years the pain changed - it‚Äôs worse, it hits different, it‚Äôs debilitating, painkillers don‚Äôt work, I‚Äôm stuck in bed for days. It hurts when I pee, when I poop, when I move; I get butt lightnings, heavy pulling pain in my uterus, painful gas; it wasn‚Äôt like this before and naturally, I went to see a gynecologist. Never had penetrative sex, my periods are quite regular otherwise. 

My first gynecologist was an older lady, very professional and experienced. However, listening to my complaints, she concluded mid-way I was fine without even initially running any tests. She then did an abdominal ultrasound, found a few cysts on each ovary and said those are normal as well, and prescribed to me ... a supplement and an even heavier NSAID (after I told her they don‚Äôt work on me). I was disheartened but still believed in her decision. Fast forward to my following period, I was in even worse pain, her supplement and prescription strength NSAID had no effect. 

I then went to consult another gynecologist for a second opinion. It was a younger lady. She listened to my complaints, then went on to explain to me thoroughly about the types of period pain and the conditions that could be causing them. She said there is no use to keep stuffing myself with painkillers and that it‚Äôs more harm than good at that point. She concluded that it might be endometriosis and suggested putting me on the pill to hopefully ease the severe pain and PMS and help rule out whether it‚Äôs endo or not. I was .. shocked. Wow! An actual treatment. And my pain wasn‚Äôt brushed off as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. 

Have any of you noticed this in your experience with gynecologists (or other doctors)?

EDIT: I just created r/LabiaplastySurgery so hopefully interested women will find us over there and we can build a little community!

The basics: I'm 23 and got a bilateral labiaplasty on Dec. 14 because my labia minora were 2.5-3 inches long and were extremely annoying and uncomfortable. I asked my OBGYN about a labiaplasty during a routine exam and he basically said, ""Yep. They are pretty long. I can get your insurance to cover it, let's book the operation."" So I did and here I am 1 week out. 

There was a complication where they couldn't get me to stop bleeding during the procedure and I ended up developing a pretty gnarly hematoma (basically a really severe bruise where there's so much blood trapped under the skin that it forms a pocket/sac). The pain was intense and I spent a night in the ER on morphine where doctors monitored the hematoma and were prepared to lance it the next morning if there was no improvement. They decided it would be more risky to open it back up and drain it, so they sent me home and it ended up going almost completely away as of today (7 days since procedure). That's a pretty rare complication as far as I know.

It's still swollen and puffy and painful but it is steadily improving. I'm on 5-10mg oxycodone & ibuprofen.

m26em3,Periods,1615405140.0,"Anyone find it immensely frustrating when men try to compare their pains to having a period? 

My best friend (a male) and I have been going back and forth about what‚Äôs more painful. He says that getting kicked in the balls is more painful than girls have on their periods, that prostate exams that men usually get are more painful than a pap smear, and so on. Saying that men have it so much worse than we do. He said that as girls get older we learn to deal with our periods more... Well, I‚Äôve had my period for almost 15 years now and I‚Äôm still trying to find ways on how to deal with it each month.

Not to mention, we have periods to tell us that we‚Äôre not pregnant. In reality most of us probably only get 1-2 normal weeks in a month. With PMSing, ovulation, and our actual periods we can feel all over the place and out of sorts. And of course the pain and cramps that comes with periods. 

So why do men feel the need to compare these things to use and belittle us in a sense? It can be so frustrating sometimes. Sure each gender goes through something different but it‚Äôs only thing to try to ‚Äúone-up‚Äù women and their periods, pap smears, pregnancy, etc. It‚Äôs especially frustrating when men try to tell us what to do with our bodies when they don‚Äôt even have a uterus.

14a3whe,WomensHealth,1686839413.0,"The present-day pelvic exam, born through the graceless adequacy of a bent gravy spoon to an overzealous surgeon in the mid-19th century, is a nightmare. Women all over curse the scene: the cold, clanky metal, the inelegance, the uncomfortable endogenous stretching ‚Äî or is it pressure? But along with 65 million other women in the United States each year, I reluctantly make my appointment to be poked, prodded, and probed by a stranger all for the reassurance that my vagina looks ordinary.

Upon arrival at the gynecologist‚Äôs, I am taken to an exam room, weighed, and asked about my sexual history and menstrual cycle before the clinician politely asks me to undress. When they step out, I strip down, fold my clothes neatly, and place them on the chair. God forbid the person who is about to have their hand inside me is offended by the sight of my panties, so I take care to tuck them under my jeans. I replace them with a sterile johnny and assume my position at the edge of the exam table, tearing the crinkly paper beneath me. I spend the rest of my time alone biting my fingernails and reading the hand-washing posters on the wall ‚Äî failed attempts to distract myself from my nervous anticipation of the procedure to come.

Within minutes, I‚Äôm lying spread-eagled with my feet in stirrups and the clinician‚Äôs face disconcertingly close to my nether regions. As I hold my breath, the practitioner, with a smile too cheery for the situation, produces a jangly steel clamp that would not look out of place in an assortment of medieval torture devices. The bivalve thing taunts me with its clumsy tambourine clatter as its sharp edges enter my most sensitive anatomy. Once inside, a scissor-like mechanism opens me up to reveal my cervix.

The instrument, formally known as the vaginal speculum, is as technologically primitive as the era that spawned it ‚Äî a maladroit, Procrustean apparatus guaranteed to unsettle even the strongest of constitutions. As I reclined on a clammy table in a clinic in Boston, home of one of the most progressive medical and biotechnology ecosystems in the world, it struck me: How, in a time of untold innovation such as we live in, is this aspect of women‚Äôs health care ‚Äî the dreaded pelvic exam ‚Äî still stuck in the 19th century?

Not long after, I decided first to take aim at the speculum and next, to reconsider the pelvic exam.

yf966z,Healthyhooha,1666918900.0,"I‚Äôve been dealing with vaginal issues for 2 YEARS. It‚Äôs been exhausting. Since the very beginning, I realized that most doctors don‚Äôt know SHIT about complicated vaginal issues. In my first year of dealing with mystery vaginal irritation/recurring infections, I saw over 10 different doctors, including a urogynecologist. I tried every treatment you could think of. No one could give me answers beyond ‚Äúwear cotton underwear‚Äù or ‚Äúdon‚Äôt use soap down there‚Äù. It was so beyond frustrating to have to be my own doctor. I researched online, I read articles. At one point I suggested I might have CV to a doctor, and she said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not a thing‚Äù. I was told I wasn‚Äôt swollen or red by people who were looking at my vagina for the first time. I explained my symptoms and triggers again and again, to no avail. No one could help me. 

I‚Äôm doing sort of better now, but it saddens me to see similar experiences on this subreddit every day. I feel like women‚Äôs healthcare is getting WORSE. Why is it so impossible to get decent and compassionate care? This week I had that familiar itch, and the only person I could get in with on short notice was a midwife. She was completely dismissive about my history, didn‚Äôt ask any questions other than the usual ‚Äúdo you sleep with no underwear‚Äù and ‚Äúdo you use scented detergent‚Äù. She asked me these questions after I TOLD her I‚Äôd been having recurring vaginal issues for TWO YEARS. Like I‚Äôm so stupid I hadn‚Äôt thought of those things??? SO Insulting. 

Anyways. The other thing that really pissed me off was as she was swabbing me, she asked if I planned to have kids. I told her not at this time, and she kept going on and on about it. Telling me I was getting older, things would be more dangerous‚Ä¶to add insult to injury. I left that appointment with a confirmed yeast infection and SO much anger and sadness. I know she‚Äôs a midwife so she probably focuses on babies and shit, but god damn-can‚Äôt I get swabbed without getting that talk? Is being a woman only about being able to get pregnant? 

I feel like If I were to tell a doctor I wanted to get pregnant but I had recurring issues, I would get better care than if I were to just say I had recurring issues. Also, to reiterate-most doctors don‚Äôt know shit about vaginal infections-so don‚Äôt rely on the alone to help you. I had doctor after doctor just tell me to do metronidazole, even though it never worked long term.

My gyno explained this to me like it would be NO BIG DEAL. Fine. I get there, didn't realize it's a whole ""procedure"" that I needed to sign for.

I used to feel inferior to these daily washers but now I‚Äôm wondering if half these people even wash? What do they do in there? Just let the water get them wet and call it a shower?

I‚Äôve even seen people say they just use their hands to wash.

How often do you shower? What do you actually do in the shower? Do you shower the same every time or have special showers where you actually clean your body?

1auboef,Healthyhooha,1708308120.0," When you hit menopause, the amount of estrogen in your body drops precipitously, some to zero production anywhere. The outer vaginal area including the urethral tissue opening is coated in androgen receptors- when they stop receiving androgens/sex hormones in the form of estrogen, they start to collapse on themselves, preventing normal emptying of the urethra, and causing more infections.

Low dose local estrogen cream, applied to the area topically 3x a week, effectively nourishes these tissues and can prevent vaginal atrophy and urethral atrophy, preserving sexual and urinary function into old age. This low local dose does not affect systemic estrogen levels, and can be started at any phase of menopause or post-menopause. It's about $30 a month through reasonable insurance costs, though I've seen some companies charging more. You have to go around to find a doctor that will give a continuous prescription because it's like brushing you're teeth- you need to do it forever.

uig911,WomensHealth,1651697414.0,"What about me? I was 35 at the time and found out I was pregnant with baby # 3! We were over the moon excited. This was such a blessing for our family. We could not wait to tell our family and friends. We told our first two children two days before Christmas. We said we had an early present for them. To see the joy on their faces and to witness the excitement knowing they were going to have another sibling was something I will never forget. That joy soon faded away. Three days later I went to have my 12 week ultrasound. We were planning our gender reveal for that night. I saw the whole thing planned in my head. Then the ultrasound tech started asking me questions, she was pressing down hard on my stomach trying to get a better picture. I was wincing in pain and squeezing my husband‚Äôs hand, still smiling trying to figure out names for my new baby. Then the Dr came in and she began to do conduct my ultrasound. It was then that I knew something was wrong. She started explaining to me that my baby‚Äôs nuchal was not the size it should be. She started speaking but all I could hear was noise. I could not believe the words that were coming out of her mouth. How could this happen? Down syndrome, Trisomy 18, Trisomy 13, all things I have heard of but didn‚Äôt think could ever be a part of my life. The next thing I knew I was dressed and sitting in the doctor‚Äôs office and she was asking me if I wanted to continue with this pregnancy or did I want to terminate. She said I should consider this because in NY women only have the right to terminate the pregnancy up until 24? Weeks. I can‚Äôt really remember the exact number because at that point I was crying my eyes out and saying why me? I walked into the hospital full of joy and walked out full of sorrow and questions. I was determined not have any disease. I prayed to God to make it be all a dream. The next day I made an appointment to have a CVS test performed to see if we could get clearer results. I had to sit with a genetic counselor and we had to go over all of these things that I did not want to. Hearing how long the results would take put a knife deeper into my chest. I had to live 10 days longer not knowing any answers. Do you know how long that feels like. Smiling to my children and trying not to break down when they kissed my belly because they were so happy to have a new baby. Trying not to scream when they would ask me a question about the baby because I wasn‚Äôt sure if there was going to be a baby there anymore. All of this going on in my head asking God to give me the strength to get through the next few weeks. Questions, that‚Äôs all I had. What if‚Äôs, well what if I continue on and the baby dies right after I give birth? What if I continue on and I miscarry at 35 weeks? What if the baby is born and dies a week later? These are questions no parent should ever have to have go through their head. We got the preliminary results back and it showed that the baby did NOT have any disease!! WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why did the doctor tell me this for? How can this be? Go back for another scan. Emotions are scattered and hopes are high. If the nuchal is different in this sono then maybe we have a chance. NOPE!! Techs still see there is an issue. The Dr. informs us that our daughter most likely has turner syndrome. OUR DAUGHTER!!!!!!!!! My hopes were shattered again. People with turners do not live a full life says web md. How will our life be different? Can I handle a child with a disability? Will I have to quit my job? Who will be there to help with my other kids? Can we afford this? QUESTIONS!!!!! As my husband and I are driving home from that appointment we get a call from the genetic counselor to tell us that the prelim results were incorrect!!! Our baby indeed had Trisomy 18. What did that mean? Trusty google tells me that means that my baby can die before its born, die 2 minutes after I deliver, 2 hours, 2 days, 2 weeks after birth. Having that news answered some of my questions. But now WE had to make a decision. My husband and I had to make a decision of what WE wanted to do with our family. Keep in mind my other two children notice that mommy and daddy are upset all the time and sad. Mommy cries a lot and all she wants to do is sleep. What decision do we make? Time is running out, we need to make this decision because we only have a few weeks left before WE are not allowed to make a decision anymore. What I want you to take from this is knowing that I had a CHOICE. I knew that the ultimate decision to make was mine. I was up against a time clock but in the end I still had time to make that decision. I can‚Äôt imagine having to go through what I went through and not have the CHOICE to do what was best for my family and I. I get the people who say that a fetus cannot make a decision for themselves. I understand that. But what is the purpose of being a parent? Aren‚Äôt we supposed to protect our children and guide them and help them make decisions for themselves? Have you ever asked a 5 year old what they want for dinner? Should I ask my one year old if he wants Tylenol because his new molars are coming in? As a parent we are obliged to make decisions for our kids everyday.

I‚Äôve been on the pill for 10 years and with recent events in the US I decided maybe it‚Äôs best to try an IUD for a more permanent option. I got kyleena inserted last week and had no issues other than the initial insertion pain. A few days ago I woke up with a fever, chills, discharge, and sharp pelvic pain. I knew this had to be related to my IUD so I made a same day appointment at my obgyn to get it removed. The nurse almost turned me away before I got to see the doctor due to my high fever and suggested I take some Tylenol and stay home  instead. I just knew that my sickness had to be related to my IUD, this was no normal flu, so I pushed to see the doctor that day. The doctor came to do a pelvic exam and quickly pulled it out like I begged her too and she gave me some antibiotics to ease the symptoms and fix the infection. 

The next day I woke up with the same fever and chills but I couldn‚Äôt remove my body, I could hardly get dressed or eat. My pelvic pain had mostly subsided but I didn‚Äôt feel much better. I mustered up the guts to go to an urgent care and they ran a blood test and almost immediately pushed me out the door to go to the ER. I got to the ER and discovered that basically my IUD and the infection were related, I got pneumonia and went into sepsis which explains the fever and my exponential WBC count. Just my luck, I also turned out to be allergic to the antibiotics that my obgyn prescribed and I broke out into a full body rash.

After a few days of fluids and antibiotics, I was discharged and now I‚Äôm home with some meds that I‚Äôll finish in the next couple days. I‚Äôm extremely lucky that I was able to know I wasn‚Äôt well and that my obgyn would remove my IUD so soon after insertion.

I get infections with or without a condom and yesterday for some reason I decided to sniff the Skyn Condoms we occasionally use (we use them purely for a barrier, not for pregnancy prevention). I started looking into it and apparently there is fragrance oil added to camouflage the condom smell that all condoms have. 

Upon searching for non latex, non lubricated condoms, I find nothing but an article with a female condom that is basically like ""wash it out and use it, it should be fine."" I kinda want to die and this infuriates me. Why do condoms have fragrance? Why are there not some plain condoms that don't have some fucking additive to fuck vaginas up?

Just wanted to make a PSA in case anyone else has been having issues and unable to find the culprit. The fragrance oil in Skyn condoms might be it.

106enap,Healthyhooha,1673168601.0,"Had years-long experience going to multiple gynecologists with what started as chronic yeast and bv infections. But then there were no more infections. The symptoms lingered and I also had that very sensitive and uncomfortable awareness of my urethra, bladder pain, Urinary frequency, itching and irritation of my labia, and pain in my vagina sometimes during sex, sometimes not.

Throughout this experience, I was finally seen by a urogynecologist who recognized that I had a hypertonic muscle in my pelvic floor. I was referred to a pelvic floor therapist and my symptoms gradually remitted for a long time following therapy.

Recently had a scare where I thought I had a yeast infection. Used boric acid and it messed me up, I had an awful reaction. All the same symptoms I had before- back in full force. I was terrified and got in to see my gynecologist right away. They prescribed me a muscle relaxer to use three times a day. This helped a lot. Started doing a routine I found on YouTube for pelvic floor release and using my pelvic floor wand once it started hurting less. Pain and symptoms- totally gone. And the tests came back negative. I am always in awe of how muscular issues in pelvic floor can so mimic an infection. And I don‚Äôt think doctors discuss this enough if ever because it took me years to find a urogynecologist who did.

Tl;dr pelvic floor dysfunction / muscle spasm can feel just like a uti, bv, or a yeast infection. It is crazy. If you have unremitting pain and infections have been ruled out consider a pelvic floor physical therapist

ki5bn7,WomensHealth,1608643693.0,"Content Warning: many anecdotes of suffering and doctors failing to do their job.

----------------------------

Posting this here because I don't feel safe posting this in some other more generic medical oriented place and I just wanted a warm place full of women to vent to so I hope this is alright, but I'm also curious if other queer women/women of color in this sub have shared experiences since I know there's a lot that do.

Anyways; in an attempt to sum up the majority of my situation; since march (coincidentally the same time lockdown happened) i began to experience terrible bladder symptoms. (I chalked it up to a UTI, went to the ER, the attending doctor spoke to me and said the same thing I thought; that it was a UTI; gave me antibiotics, sent me on my way. They helped, but it didn't quite go away after 7 days so I requested another weeks worth since it was helping.

This doctor was different. he was rude, dismissive and claimed I never had a UTI because nothing grew in the urine culture. It was the blood and the nitrates in my urine that prompted the uti diagnosis, obviously there wasn't time to see if the culture would grow yet but the female doctor was confident as was I.

Anyways, long story short, it's December and I'm still dealing with those UTI symptoms. Theres always blood and nitrates in my urine 50+ urine samples later through out the year; but nothing grows so they dismiss it, and for some reason the consistent blood and nitrates doesn't at all convince them to dig further; so I've suffered needlessly with that.

Next for the last 5 weeks, since I had a tooth extraction, things go sideways. My tongue turns white, I'm having the worst  post tooth distraction pain ever (wasn't my first rodeo) and my esophagus kept closing up on me; plus i passed out. that was the first day; second day i eat food for the first time since the extraction, my stomach goes nuclear. bloats up, dire pain in the right-of-center, lower right, mid right, just excrutiating. I return to the ER twice that night because its literally the worst thing I've ever dealt with in my life (and I've had bad pneumonia; more on that later) they do NOTHING. and after 12 hours of doing nothing but a blood test and the doctor having the nerve to say i was fine. I asked him if he'd be at least willing to do an ultrasound; he laughed and said ""he didn't need to because he knew i was fine; then he threatened to call security""

Stomach pain continues; i end up not eating a thing for over a week; and this is ontop of the bladder issues I'm still coping with and what has nowbecome dry socket of my tooth extraction.

The following week, its not getting better, its getting worse, so I go back to the hospital, but this time under my dentists orders because he's worried that my tooth infection may still be around.

The doctor sees me; I instruct him to call my dentist as I was told to and then he inspects my mouth ""Looks fine."" he says. 

""What about my white tongue?""

""Discoloration, you need to brush your teeth more""

and that was essentially it, i was dismissed. I was also told that night not to come back to the ER anymore unless I was *vomiting blood everywhere*

So i go to my dentist the next day; he takes one look at my tongue and diagnoses it as thrush and refers to my attending ER doctor the night before as an *idiot* 

So I get thrush stuff for my mouth but its not really helping, another week goes by and my uncle helpsme out and sets me up with an appointment with his family doctor.

-------------------------------------------

As an aside, I'll note that I blame my original family doctor for the death of my 55 year old mother who suffered through years of his dismissals, bullying her, mocking her, gaslighting her, until she was afraid to go back and so her cancer came back and she died.

I've been in a similar boat; as in 2017; for a month I was having trouble breathing and I had cold-like symptoms. my doctor including 2 ER doctors and 2 walk-in-clinic doctors; ALL said it was a mild cold or a nasal drip. one had the nerve to tell me to *toughen up* 

So I did, I went home, and just tried to deal with it. I lost my job at the time because I was unable to work for over a month. So a month goes by and its getting *worse* finally I call my doctors office again and by luck he's on a golfing vacation so he has a fill in doctor. I see this doctor and like RIGHT AWAY he expresses concern and sends me to get an emergency x-ray.

Sure enough not only did I have pneumonia, but 76% of my lungs were fucked. He commented that he didn't understand how I was talking fine and walking fine (helloooo, woman with chronic pain constantly ignored by doctors over here; kind of used to coping through suffering) So I tried to make a joke because I've literally dealt with it for a month by saying ""well I was told it was a nasal drip so I *toughened up* like they told me to. I was trying to be sassy and he yelled at me that it was serious and I could die. I decided not to say ""blame the medical system, not me"" but I wanted to.... anyways needed to add that little story for later relevancy

-----------------------------

Alright so this new family doctor; writs down everything I'm dealing with, takes a lot of notes. sends me to do a bunch of blood and urine tests and stuff. a week later he's like ""yeah so I'm prescribing you an anti depressant"" since he believed *that* was the source of all my issues, *like yeah totally, my depression is causing the loss of my bladder, bowel and disgestion functions, makes perfect sense!*

I warned him i had been on that type before and I had a bad reaction to it (suicidal thoghts/mental breakdown) and i also said i was weary about going through that again since I'm already at the end of my rope. He insisted and ignored me, stating ""this is the best one there is, it'll work""

So like clockwork; 3 days in I'm having a full manic melt down , my brains not working, so I call his office; no answer, of course. so I decide to just stop taking them, and it got better.

So the next week I call him explain that I'm not taking them and would be more than happy to experiment with them *when* I'm healthier. He finally caved and agreed to set me up with a gastroenterologist for my stomach problems and I talk to that doctor within the week. he decides my thrush not going away despite using a medication for it the entire time, could be a worse problem; wont know for sure until the endoscope, but he prescribes me a stronger anti fungal, which was reassuring especially since these tests could  take months.

So moving on to this last week; the tooth pain comes back, this time its the tooth next to my extraction, the gums swell, my cheek swells, i start getting brain fog, headaches, shakey, heart palpatations. I already hadn't been sleeping but now it wasn't even worth trying. so I get into my dentist the day he's closing up for the holidays and he says it doesn't look infected. 

(Note: my dentist ironically has been the only doctor that feels like he's been on my side and actually cares. to put it into perspective, most Canadians pay out of pocket for dental as it isn't covered by the generic medical that all canadians get, and yet he took hours out of his time to speak to me, calling me, checking up on me, to make sure i was alright and even giving me dietary suggestions to ease my suffering for my current stomach issues. solid guy)

So I trust him, but 3 days in, its getting so bad, head is throbbing, face is swollen, gums in that area are huge and pained, and i cant sleep despite being beyond exhausted. i passout form exhaustion an di wake up every 5 minutes to the palpatations of my heart and throbbing of my face.

Now we get to tonight. Its worse and worse (ofcourse on top of bladder issues, stomach issues, and chronic muscle pain) Im trying my best to to just remain curled up in my chair, trying to get through it, when suddenly my right eye starts hurting like crazy out of no where. and my immediate thought is *this is an infection and now its getting out of control* So I suck it up and go back to the ER and think ""screw it, even if I'm not vomiting blood""

So I get in, and the attending ER doctor that sees me, is the same guy who looked at my mouth before; said it was fine and my tongue was just discolored, so immediately my heart has sank.

So, when he asks me what the problem i tonight (since he recognized me) I explain ""ive still got a lot of unexplained symptoms but all im here for tonight is fear that I have a tooth infection because my head is throbbihng, im shaking, i have had a head ache for a week and constant brain fog and then I mention my eye started hurting too right before i came in.

He takes a look at my mouth. dismissively says it looks fine, the same way he did the first time; then i ask him to look at my eye; he does; ""looks fine"" he says, and by that point he's already  heading to leave and send me home and so i have a melt down.

I start crying, I call him dismissive and i call him out for misdiagnosing the thrush the first time; and he kind of shrugs and says ""i was just calling it how i saw it"" and then hes like 'you should be at a dentist not here"" (mind you its like 1 in the morning, no dentists are open at 1 in the morning, and my dentist is on xmas holidays till the 4th)

so I say ""fine yeah ill go, its not like ive been sititng in the fetal posiiton for 5 weeks, not sleeping, not eating; but I sure am 'fine' (Mind you I dont usually get that way with doctors but after suffering so much, im so sick of them doing nothing.)

This is when I'm barely getting my words out because I'm crying (sometimes the really rude dismissive doctors make me cry then they use that to call me emotional and build it up to prove I'm just over exaggerating) but I go off on a rant about how my grandmother died at 61 because a doctor dismissed early symptoms of cancer and that my mom died at 55, because she was gaslit so much by her doctor she was *afraid* to go back and it killed her and that i nearly died in 2017 because many doctors ""were just saying how they saw it"" and I was tired of doctors being dismissive rather than actually *listening* to the patient.

anyways, my dismissive comment clearly bothered him because he started repeating ""im not being dismissive!"" and then he said ""fine what do you want / what do you think you need from me"" 

and I cried again and said ""I dont know; thats the problem? I dont know whats wrong with me, but I know its bad--but it doesnt matter, all i came here for was fear of an infection because Im already dealing with SO MUCH pain and organ issues, I literally dont have the mental capacity to deal with more, but you say it doesnt look infected so ill take your word for it and have peace of mind and just suffer through till i can see my dentist"" and I get up to leave; he stops me and says ""what about some iv fluids? (fyi im severely malnourished and dehydrated due to my stomach issue) so I say ""alright fine"" and then he offers me something for the inflammation and some atavan to calm me down.

the fluids were a tiny bit revitalizing but nothing else really helped and he comes back after and says ""alright; it helped?"" and by this point im tired and i know hes trying to get rid of me again so I say ""yeah a little I think."" then i rub my eye again and I add ""but my eye is still really bugging me""

So, obviously determined to prove he's not dismissive, he leaves and rolls in this mega scope thing. drops some numbing stuff in my eye and some dye and starts looking at it under this bright blue light; and sure enough, I can tell something is wrong because he's taking a long time to look at my eye. Finally after an uncomfortable length of sitting still, he says he found something weird; starts asking me a bunch of weird questions, all of which I answered No to, which confounded him more; weirder yet he had to go get another doctor to come in and do it again on me for a second opinion.

After they discussed, he explained he was prescribing me an antiviral for some thing in my eye and setting me up with an eye doctor because apparently if this goes unchecked i can go blind; and it could be the cause of all the head throbbing pain I've had of late, so there we go, FINALLY one out of like 10 major things I'm dealing with, *actually* gets an explanation. I was really appreciative of him after that but then he had to ruin it by being smug and saying ""bet you're glad you didnt walk out""


I just said 'yes' but oof I wanted to say ""yeah im glad I kicked your ass into acting like an actual fucking doctor for once"" because the only reason I was ready to leave is because im so fed up with the dismissive attitude, but me calling him on it actually seemed to work. but thats my whole problem. I shouldnt have to be driven to tears and forced to unload some speech in an attempt to revive his missing empathy *just* to get the doctor to run a test on the thing im complaining about. *you know like a doctor is paid to do*

So anyways, whew, that was an obscenely long rant that i needed to get off my chest. I'm a queer woman and I've put up with this behavior most of my life, but with everything getting so bad, I'm terrified I'm going to die like my mom and grandmother, all because some doctor is too full of his own ego, and the year before my mother died, she was dealing with nearly the same symptoms i have been; trouble walking, bladder issues, digestive issues, bowel issues, progressively more nearing the end, and with her eventually going blind as well.

So yeah that just adds more stress and paranoia to me, because doctors either ignore most of my symptoms or refuse to entertain even the slimmest possibility there may be a connection as I've been dealing with the same thing, organ failure after organ failure.

Anyways sorry about that, thank you for reading my rant if you did, really just need solidarity from other women right now, especially women who know exactly what I'm talking about.

I had the Mirena IUD put in in my early 30s. The process, for me, was so painful that I fainted on the table. I regained consciousness to an empty room and an oxygen mask over my face.

I was so embarrassed - I got dressed and ran out. 

Fast forward a few years. I'm supposed to have a colposcopy with cervical biopsy.

What I want to understand is why this is considered normal practice? Why are we not numbing the cervix and warning ladies ahead of time about the *real* pain associated with what they're having done? These doctors are going to remove live tissue with an endocervical curette or some special type of forceps, and we're expected to just lay there quietly while they do this!? This is insanity. Why are we allowing this?

flr0jx,Healthyhooha,1584689956.0,"I'm writing this in tears of frustration because I'm so tired of this bullshit.

I had surgery in September to remove an infected Bartholin's gland that had become a nasty abscess internally growing *into* my anus. One thousand percent the most painful experience I've ever gone through and one I pray I'll never have to go through again. The whole process of the abscess developing took less than 24 hours - literally, one day I was perfectly healthy and the next I was being rushed to the ER with agonizing pain and the worst fever of my life. I spent all night in the ER waiting for my gynecologist to get to the hospital. Only problem was, I was admitted at 2:00 am and my gynecologist couldn't come in until 11:00 am. This meant I had to endure nine whole hours of the worst pain I've ever felt, the worst fever I've ever had, and a throbbing vulva that looked as if it had been inflated like a damn balloon and was now at least quadruple its size. 

After the gynecologist arrived, she informed me of my two options: drain the abscess and send me home or remove the gland to avoid another abscess forming again. I opted for removal and was scheduled for surgery at 7:00 pm that same day. I had a fever of 104 degrees for over eighteen hours, up until the abscess was removed. The whole process was hellish. 

Finally after surgery I felt enormous relief and was excited to be sent back home. Gyno told me I had to stay on bedrest for ten days and after that I'd be just fine. 

***I must say, this was a lot of bullshit***.

It took me over two months to make a *full* recovery, seeing as incisions for these surgeries are *not* stitched, but instead left open for the wound to heal from inside out. Ladies (and curious reader), this incision was about one and a half inches deep, right next to the opening of my vagina. ***One. And a half. Inches. Deep.*** I genuinely thought the pain before surgery was bad, but the calvary that was recovering from this surgery is honestly something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. 

After weeks of daily rinses, cream and powder applications, antibiotics, painkillers and bedrest, the wound finally healed enough to where there was no visible flesh. I was finally back to my old self - walking free of pain, working out, having sex, the whole nine yards. 

Until this week, when I was hit with BV and the incision site now looks like it was stung by twenty bees. I'm having even more pain than I ever had during recovery. I can't walk, I can't sit up or sit down, I can‚Äôt sit on the toilet to pee, I can't even move while laying down without sharp, stabbing pain in my now so loathed hooha. I feel truly miserable. Thankfully my gyno is still working despite the crazy pandemic going on, and she was able to see me this week and prescribe medication. But I'm now afraid that every time I get BV or a yeast infection this is going to be my life. 

My grandmother almost slapped the living breath out of me once for saying I'd wished I was born a boy; but god damn it, I've never heard of my boyfriend going through half the shit with his penis as I have with this birthing tool.

nbvb2a,WomensHealth,1620950491.0,"People can sometimes be quick to slap on the label ‚Äúlibido issues‚Äù when they have a complicated relationship to sex. Women, in particular, can feel as if they have trouble with sexual desire, when in reality, the issue may be much more contextual.

There are¬†two types of sexual desire: spontaneous desire and responsive desire. Spontaneous desire means you can get turned on and feel like having sex almost randomly out of the blue, whereas responsive desire means you find yourself turned on when you‚Äôre already in a sexual situation. Sometimes people with responsive desire think they have a low libido, especially if their partner has spontaneous desire. But in reality, these responsive folks generally may have plenty of desire for sex‚Äîthey just need a specific context to access it. It‚Äôs not gonna just happen out of the blue.

In her groundbreaking book¬†Come As You Are, sex researcher¬†Emily Nagoski, Ph.D., describes sexual context as one of the most important elements of female sexual desire. She writes, ‚ÄúContext is made of two things: the circumstances of the present moment‚Äîwhom you‚Äôre with, where you are, whether the situation is novel or familiar, risky or safe, etc.‚Äîand your brain state in the present moment‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre relaxed or stressed, trusting or not, loving or not, right now, in the moment.‚Äù¬†

Back in 2010, research by clinical psychologists¬†Katie McCall, Ph.D., and¬†Cindy Meston, Ph.D., identified four¬†categories of sexual cues¬†that are key to women‚Äôs sexual desire:

1.¬†Love/emotional bonding cues

For some people, feeling close and emotionally connected to your partner in a given moment is part of what makes you feel like having sex. Nagoski offered this example in her book: ‚ÄúA woman told me the extraordinarily romantic story of a boyfriend who flew halfway around the globe to surprise her for their second anniversary of dating. Talk about closeness, commitment, and special attention. Yeah, that man got¬†laid.‚Äù

Some examples of this type of cue from McCall and Meston‚Äôs research:¬†

\- Feeling a sense of love with a partner

\- Feeling a sense of security in your relationship

\- Your partner is supportive of you

\- Your partner does ‚Äúspecial‚Äù or ‚Äúloving‚Äù things for you

\- Feeling a sense of commitment from a partner

\- Your partner expresses interest in hearing about you

\- Talking about the future with your partner

\- Feeling protected by a partner or protective of a partner

2.¬†Explicit/erotic cues

These have to do with more obviously sexual cues, like watching, reading, or hearing something sexy happening. You might not be in the mood for sex at all, but then you find yourself in the middle of an intensely hot¬†Outlander¬†scene, and suddenly you‚Äôre¬†feeling¬†it.

Some examples from McCall and Meston:¬†

\- Watching a sexy movie

\- Watching or listening to other people having sex

\- Talking about sex or ‚Äútalking dirty‚Äù

\- Sensing your own or your partner‚Äôs wetness or erection

\- Asking for or anticipating sexual activity

\- Hearing your partner tell you that they fantasized about you

\- Having a sexual fantasy (e.g., having a sexual dream, daydreaming)

3.¬†Visual/proximity cues

Sometimes there are certain types of behaviors, body types, or body parts that just get you going when you see them. It might be catching a glimpse of a girl‚Äôs bare hip bones or seeing a dude take off his shirt to reveal tattoos all over his toned arms.¬†

Some other examples from McCall and Meston:¬†

\- Seeing someone who is well-dressed or ‚Äúhas class‚Äù

\- Seeing/talking with someone powerful or famous

\- Being in proximity to attractive people

\- Watching someone engage in physical activities (e.g., sports)

\- Seeing someone act confidently

\- Seeing/talking with someone intelligent

\- Flirting with someone or having someone flirt with you

4.¬†Romantic/implicit cues¬†

These are intimate situations that just have that romantic vibe to them. Nagoski gave this example: ‚ÄúA woman in her 30s told me that she and her husband were saving up to remodel their bathroom, after they realized that a reason she was so keen for sex when they went on vacation was that they took long, hot (in every sense) baths together in the giant tubs at the B-and-Bs where they stayed. More baths, more sex.‚Äù

Some examples of the type of cue from McCall and Meston:¬†

\- Having your partner whisper into your ear or whispering into theirs

\- Dancing closely

\- Watching a sunset

\- Having a romantic dinner

\- Watching a romantic movie

\- Being in a hot tub

\- Touching your partner‚Äôs hair or face

\- Giving or receiving a massage

\- Laughing with your partner

\- Smelling pleasant scents (e.g., perfume/cologne, shampoo, aftershave)

Figuring out your ideal sexual context.¬†

How much each of these types of cues matter will depend on the individual. Some might be more important for you, while others might be less so. Couples‚Äô therapist¬†Alicia Mu√±oz, LPC, has a guided exercise for¬†figuring out your ideal sexual context.

‚ÄúSince most of us won‚Äôt stumble on a magic relationship lantern or sex genie in this lifetime,‚Äù she writes, ‚Äúconsciously understanding the different contextual factors‚Äîinternal and external‚Äîthat support and contribute to our personal experience of enjoyable sex is one of the most accessible and realistic paths to sexually empowering ourselves.‚Äù

If you‚Äôre someone who feels like they struggle with sexual desire, spend some time sitting and thinking through what contextual cues tend to make you feel turned on. Once you know what they are, you can focus on bringing more of those elements into your life so that you can access your desire whenever you want.

Not to mention, I was  h o r n y (freaked me out a little bit, my vag and clit area were so constantly aroused and sensitive, i had to masturbate several times a day to be able to focus on work!) 

Normally my period does not affect me that much, but this week was particularly brutal.

Cut to my therapist appointment. He asks me how I  am doing, I tell him I had a rough week. I think it best to pr√©cise that I was on a rough period, and that the natural hormonal cycle might be the main culprit. Nothing to worry about. 

Instead, he jumped on the period thing. He told the theory that my period made me depressed because it brought out a complex towards my feminity, my vaginism and my fertility. 

I tried to tell him that period may seem like a big symbolic deal to people that don't have it, but to women it's literally just a normal body fonction like bowel movements. Hormones impact our psychological state. 

But no, he was convinced my period brought out my subconscious trauma of my mother imposing her view of womanhood on me, and of my unhability to have vaginal intercourse. 

You know, at this point it is just funny to me how men are so estranged and borderline mesmerized by our periods üòÇ always trying to slap some big symbolism on it. Like bro, you're not psychoanalysing your self when you take a shit every morning, relax!

He also asked if it hurts because of my vaginism. Bruh, it's liquid ü§î it trickle downs.

yrbcj3,Healthyhooha,1668077195.0,"Just saw a post about someone testing positive for an STI (not syphilis) and it reminded me of this. 

I work in a doctors office and recently we‚Äôve had a spate of positive syphilis tests-repeat testing did show that the results were in error, more on that in a second. However, the patients who had positive results initially were shocked. The most recent 2 have been in long term, stable relationships- married for more than a decade, with children etc. so it caused some worry. Not clear what had them requesting testing in the first place, but some adults have really just never had a full STI panel done and it occasionally occurs to them. So we order it because it‚Äôs good information for people. 

We live in a small area, the Dept. of Health tracks things like this, and there‚Äôs been no outbreaks that we could find. So we got looking into it. 

Turns out that the typical standard test for syphilis, known as an RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin), is no longer suggested for use because of some cross-reactivity since COVID vaccines came out. I‚Äôm not anti-vax, it‚Äôs just a finding. We did retest all of our patients and none of them were actually positive. Four potential cases doesn‚Äôt sound like a lot, but in a small town, small clinic, it‚Äôs kind of a startling number and if it were true would absolutely initiate some department of health tracking. 

Anyway, if you‚Äôre going in for STI testing and have been vaccinated for COVID, please make sure your doctor orders a Treponema Pallidum Particle Agglutination test, abbreviated as TP-PA. 

Apparently the announcement from the CDC is almost a year old, but somehow it didn‚Äôt get a lot of press. At least not that our doctors had heard about. In fairness, since COVID, there‚Äôs been so many things shared so often that it‚Äôs possible it was and was missed. But if this post saves even one person from a false positive and some panic, it‚Äôs served purpose. Stay safe and healthy out there, y‚Äôall.

i60v2v,Healthyhooha,1596900146.0,"Hi! I swear this isn't some creepy guy trying to get your boob measurements lol this might be weird but my boobs are HEAVY and i wanted to know how heavy they were. I don't have anyone talk about this with but I hope this sub is cool with it.

&#x200B;

Honestly, at first I just tried to get level with my kitchen counter and plopped my boob on the scale but i felt like that wasn't really accurate, like i wonder if i was putting more/less weight on it depending on how i was oriented, etc. So I googled and found out about water displacement.

&#x200B;

I used [this method](https://www.forzasupplements.co.uk/blogs/fitness-wellbeing/how-to-weigh-breasts) but instead of using a tray, i just compared the weight of the full bowl vs the bowl after water displacement and subtracted the weight of the bowl itself (I put the bowl on the floor of my shower so it didn't go everywhere). Then you have to do a conversion where you multiply by 0.9 for the density of breast tissue but idk where they got that number from, I assume it differs with fat content vs muscle, but close enough! ... Anyway I was happy to finally know just how heavy my tatas are haha (about 500 g each (+/- 40 g), for reference I'm about an E cup -- well, since the edit I suppose they're more like 600+g).

&#x200B;

Here's my method if you wanna try it:

&#x200B;

\- Get a bowl thats big enough to put your entire boob into

\- Fill the bowl with water, to the rim! If there's less water than that, your results won't be accurate. Weigh the bowl, now full of water. You can fill it most of the way, set it on the scale, then get the rest of the water with a cup or something (it's hard to move a full bowl without spilling). Mark down the full bowl's weight. (This is number A, e.g. 3000g)

\- Go to your bathroom, put the bowl on your flat shower floor and stick your boob in lol. Water should be displacing from the bowl. Make sure you get your full boob in there.

\- Dry yourself off and weigh the bowl again with whats left in it. Mark it down, make sure you write down if it's the left or the right (Number B, e.g. 2200 g)

\- Fill the bowl again and do it again, but with the other boob. Dry yourself off and weigh whats left again, now marking the other number.  (Number C,  e.g. 2300 g)

&#x200B;

The math:

\- First, get the difference between the full bowl and the water-displaced bowl by subtracting A from B.

\- With my examples, this looks like: 3000-2200 = 800. This is the amount of water that you displaced. 

\- Now multiply by 0.9 for breast tissue density = 800 g \* 0.9 = 720 g. One boob is 720g!

\- For the other breast, do the same but with C and A.  3000-2300 = 700. . Now adjusted for breast tissue density, 500 * 0.9 = 630 g.

\- Your boobs are 720and 630g each!

&#x200B;

I hope that makes sense for you, I was always bad at math so please do correct me if this is wrong lol.

Edit: The original post said to weigh and subtract the empty bowl but this is not necessary: 
>You dont need to subtract the weight of the bowl. The bowl is a constant between both measurements, so the difference between the full bowl and the part empty bowl is just the weight of the water.

Hello reddit, my name is Fl√°via and I'm a 15 year old girl. I was always behind in developing compared to fellow girls. My height only 135 cm (4'5"") and my weight just 28,5 kg (63 ibs). I have so far have no signs of breast developing ever, no hair, armpits, pubic, no period.

I posted about the issue very concerned. My parents wanted test me for Turner syndrome but because of my age they were worried it is too late. Today I was taken in for gynaecology exam. What they found is: I will never have a period! The doctor looked at me, said ""Fl√°via, I do not know how to explain this to you. You will never have a period. Ever."" I was so heartbroken because like I was always behind, know I know that I will forever be behind. In the scan they find out: I do not have tubes, uterus, cervix, or vagina. But I do have ovaries, and they do not work well at all, they lack a function. I was diagnosed with what I think it is called Mayer Rokitansky Kuster Hauser syndrome.

Backstory: 
I only dated women for a few years and my vagina was pristine. I unexpectedly fell in love with a lovely man, unfortunately that‚Äôs when my problems started. 
The smell was bad and nothing would help. I peed after sex, washed my vulva with soap and water, scooped cum out with my fingers so it wouldn‚Äôt stay in there, drank water, went commando or wore cotton. I mostly eat fresh veggies, rice and lean proteins. I ferment my own veggies or regularly consume kimchi and yogurt. brag. 

And yet my discharge was like thin and metallic. Or fishy. Or just b.o. 

Truthfully I found it unbearable. There wasn‚Äôt anyone I felt I could go to. I was too poor to go to the doctor. I made him stop giving me head and just felt so worthless to be honest. Even now I actually still don‚Äôt do oral because I‚Äôm still dealing with feelings of shame. 

Anyways the solution was probiotics all along. Trader Joe‚Äôs general probiotic took away the smell immediately and then a Target woman‚Äôs health one really fixed me up. I just needed a more demons swimming around my vaginal walls or however scientists say that. I make the bf take a mens one too.

I forgot to pick it up and when my boyfriend went to the bathroom, he suddenly rushes out again. I go ‚ÄûWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äú. So he says ‚ÄûYou forgot something on the floor, can you pick it up?‚Äú in an annoyed tone.

So I get up and there lies the small paper-plastic thing. I‚Äòm shocked: I‚Äòve never left something behind before. This is kinda embarrassing...

I did a home STI test for Chlamydia, Gonorrhoea, Syphilis and HIV. This is just for routine testing but I put it off for a while because I didn't want to pay. I found out the government provided free testing kits and I signed up immediately. 10 days later I receive a text confirming I'm positive for only Chlamydia. 

Eventhough I'm a medical student and I understood what the infection is I still had a panic attack which ended up with a migraine. I felt ""dirty"" eventhough I knew I should think that way. I felt like I should've been extra careful even when I used condoms. It felt like a huge blow to my character and the anxiety of telling my current and ex partners from the last 3months made me feel more and more anxious.

 But in the end, I did the right thing. I notified the nearest hospital to book an appointment for treatment and notified my sexual contacts how to get tested and treated. 3 of them told me it's not my fault and they were proud that I told them. My current partner is supportive is getting treatment on Monday. Only 1 partner did not react well and shamed me for the result. I received my Doxycycline tablets today and I'll be taking the drug for a week and abstaining from sex for 2 weeks.

I cried during my consultation with the nurse. She told me that she's proud of what I did and everything will be okay. She told me I can still have a happy sexual life. I told her my concerns and she gladly booked me for a curative test in 5weeks to give me peace of mind and for my partner as well because he wants me to enjoy sex without the anxiety.

jg1v6g,Periods,1603380862.0,"My husband and I always planned on having kids someday, but at the time, we weren‚Äôt ready for it. We weren‚Äôt very financially secure, and we were renting. We wanted to have a house of our own first. Our birth control method started with me on the pill and us using the pull out method, but after multiple complications, switches of BC types, and 3 ER visits, I decided to stop taking it and we would use the pull out method alone. The pull out method worked great for us. We never had any accidents for years. 

I ended up getting a little bit of baby rabies. As embarrassing as it is, I‚Äôm not going to lie about it. It happened. Idk why, but something in my body just screamed ‚Äúprocreate!‚Äù It got worse whenever I was ovulating. One time while my husband and I were having sex, I asked him not to pull out. I meant it kind of half serious/half joking. I didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd actually do it. Well he did. It was super close to my ovulation, I believe I was on day 13 of my cycle, and my cycles were always a little off (not always 28 days, sometimes shorter, sometimes longer) so within three hours after we had sex, we went to the drug store and I got and took Plan B. 

Flash forward to the time of my expected period. There was no blood, but I felt all the other symptoms of my period. Cramps, lower back pain, tender breasts, headaches. I fully felt like I was on my period, there was just no blood. I figured that was because of the Plan B. * insert sarcastic laugh * 

About a week and a half later, my husband and I went on a small trip a few hours away with my dad so they could pick up some equipment for one of their mutual hobbies. On the way home, we stopped for lunch at a really cool oyster bar. My dad and I had been there multiple times and I got what I always ordered. After we left, I felt sick to my stomach for the first time after having this meal, and I ended up dead tired and passing out in the car. When we finally got home, my stomach was incredibly upset and I thought I had food poisoning. I was so tired and sick. 

The upset stomach went away within 24 hours, but I was still so fricken tired all the time. I ended up passing out while sitting in my car in a parking lot on a 98¬∞F day. I have pernicious anemia, and thought it was because I was due for my B12 shot soon. Nope. 

The final straw for me was when I went to go make a salad a few days later. I love spinach. I opened up the container of just-bought spinach and nearly vomited from the smell. It smelled absolutely horrible. If you‚Äôve ever opened up a container of spinach that‚Äôs about to go bad and you can kind of smell it -it was like that but x 100. I was gagging and almost vomited as I searched this crisp, fresh spinach for rot. My husband came in and smelled it, and said he couldn‚Äôt smell anything. 

The next day, I took 3 pregnancy tests. And sure enough, on every single one, there was a faint positive line. I made an appointment with my doctor to get a blood test done for confirmation. I was 5-6 weeks pregnant. Turns out, Plan B doesn‚Äôt work if you are already ovulating. 

I considered abortion, but as we were already planning on having kids, it didn‚Äôt go any further than some discussion between my husband and I, and I/we decided to go through with it. We had 9 months to get our shit in order, and we did. And now we have a beautiful 9 month old daughter. 

Figured I‚Äôd post this here for anyone wanting to read a real life experience if they are late/have a missed period, took emergency contraceptive, and thinks they might be pregnant.



Edit: I guess a lot of people are shocked to find out that Plan B doesn‚Äôt work if you take it while you‚Äôre ovulating. I found out when I talked to my doctor about me taking it and inquired about it potentially hurting the baby. She told me it won‚Äôt harm anything if you‚Äôre already pregnant, won‚Äôt work if you‚Äôre ovulating(because it prevents ovulation from happening, can‚Äôt do that if it already happened), and that if you‚Äôre above a certain weight (I can‚Äôt remember what weight it was) it will not be very effective and some women would have to take two doses.

Apparently being on antivirals and using condoms can lower the risk of giving it to another person, but it's still there. And I guess there are a lot of people who have the virus and don't even know because they've never had an outbreak.  

Truth is, I like this guy but I don't think he's gonna be my person. If I met someone and I'd feel like they could be it, I could live with the fact that there's always gonna be the risk of them giving it to me. But right now I feel like for something lowkey, casual it's just not worth it.

mkoty6,TwoXSupport,1617640550.0,"My (29) brother (31) has changed a lot over the last few years, and not for the better. He's taken a turn for the misogynistic, and borders on being a 'Nice Guy'.

We had our Easter dinner last night, and we were all just sitting around talking. My sister (26) brings up that her friend had just gone through a bad breakup, and was talking about how the ex was overly clingy, and emotionally manipulative (fabricating situations to use against the friend). My brother was silently listening, and when she was done explaining the extent of this guy's behaviour, my brother chimes in and says

""He sounds like a woman.""

We froze, and just stared at him for a second. No one knew how to respond. He had been leaning towards that line of thinking for a while now, but had never said anything that overt before. It was almost surreal.

My sister snapped out of it first, looked him dead in the eye and very curtly said

""Well that was inappropriate.""

She broke the spell, and we were able to address his statement. Both my sister and I expressed that none of our female friends behave that way, and that honestly, the only experience either of us had had with that behaviour had been from *men*.

Surprisingly, it didn't turn into a whole thing. There was no yelling or screaming, no food thrown, or flared tempers. He seemed genuinely surprised that that was our experience, and we were able to get him to conclude that he's just talking to the wrong women.

I am *extremely* proud of my sister. She's always been the type to speak up, but I had never actually witnessed it myself (I am not close to either of my siblings for reasons), and I just had to share it.

1. Trying to understand my husband's viewpoint
2. Am I wrong?

I'm 35 been married for 11 years have 2 kids. I have an active sex life with my husband and orgasm most the time during sex. Throughout our relationship (since I was 17) I have occasionally masterbated, but my husband didn't know. Over the course of our 18 years together, this topic has come up in the past when after having sex and me not having an orgasm. He would accuse me of masterbating. Most the time it was not the case, I had not and would say no. I caught on that this was an insecurity of his, so anytime I ever did do the thing, I never told him about it and throughout the years if he ever mentioned it, I would always deny it. Recently I took a job out of town where I am in a different state M-F. We have sex every weekend, because he feels unloved if we don't (yes many layers of issues here I know, stay with me) I decided to buy a vibrator to use sometimes when I was out of town. My husband ended up walking in on a conversation I was having with my best friend about it, found the vibrator and freak out a few months ago. I thought we got past it, I explained my reasons behind having it etc. Tonight he brings up that he cannot get over me having it and  me wanting to self pleasure and why can't I just wait for him on the weekend, etc. He is so angry about it that he states it is causing him anxiety depression and that I'm acting wierd. I truly feel like I've done nothing wrong by having it, it doesn't make me not have sex with him, I don't feel like it's wrong to self pleasure, yet he is making me feel like I'm doing something wrong and terrible and hurting him.

I had tried waxing myself a few times in the past few years and it was painful! At the time, I hadn‚Äôt been to a salon, so my hair was thick and coarse from shaving. 

Luckily, right before social distancing guidelines, I was diligent about making sure my hooha would be ready for summer time bikini lines! But of course, one week after my second wax, salons and such were closed. 

I‚Äôd been letting myself grow out, refusing to go back to shaving and undo the work - and money - I‚Äôd put into this self love project. But I‚Äôd finally had enough. I went out and purchased some Nair Ready - Strips and decided to do the deed myself. 

A shot of vodka and three ibuprofen later, I‚Äôm smooth as a baby‚Äôs bottom! 

Luckily, the two prior salon visits must‚Äôve helped in thinning the hairs and making removal much simpler than it had been in the past. Wasn‚Äôt nearly as painful or time consuming. 

If I can keep this up, I could save myself $50/3-6 weeks!

kr5k6s,WomensHealth,1609874571.0,"I‚Äôm absolutely sobbing as I write this:

I(19) have had over 15 yeast infections and 5 BV cases within the past two years and I am so fucking tired of feeling broken. I eat yogurt everyday, I wear cotton undies, I drink water and take probiotics, I shower after sex and I sleep commando! I don‚Äôt take antibiotics and I don‚Äôt eat a lot of sugar.

I think my first few yeast infections were caused by friction with condoms, but it didn‚Äôt start happening till almost a year after I became sexually active. My boyfriend and I used condoms for two years (yes every time), but we didn‚Äôt like the fact that everything would smell like latex and probably leave some latex particles inside of me, probably fueling the infections. 

So after suffering through almost 10 yeast infections in a year, we decided to try birth control. Due to my history of mental health issues, we ruled out the pill as it can effect depression symptoms. After talking to my doctors and my cousin who is a women health doctor, we decided the Kyleena IUD would be best. 

After that I was free from yeast infections for four months, but I had Bacterial Vaginosis and treated it with boric acid. About two months ago my boyfriend and I decided to be abstinent for a whole cycle. A month went by and I had no infection. My first month free in over a year. 

This past few weeks we decided since I was in the clear, we could try again. The times we did it were totally fine and the most enjoyable sex I‚Äôve had in a while because I wasn‚Äôt afraid of the itching or burning. 

About four days ago, I started itching and the next morning had yeast infection discharge. I am crushed. I literally cannot win. So I went to cvs and got monistat and I‚Äôm on my final day now yet it‚Äôs still a little itchy (and now it‚Äôs starting to smell what the fuck) I‚Äôve gone to the doctor so many times for my vagina and no one is helping me. The just prescribe me fluconazole and tell me to be on my way. 

Why do I feel like I‚Äôm being punished?! I am loyal to my boyfriend, I have safe sex, and I‚Äôm with a good guy. How come I have to be punished every time I have sex?! I feel like shit and I will never get over these stupid fucking reoccurring infections.

I‚Äôve been through the bv, antibiotics, yeast infection, diflucan, back to bv cycle so many times that I had pretty much given up hope and accepted celibacy after breaking up with my long term boyfriend. Even after we broke up, I tried antibiotics one more time, bought all new underwear and didn‚Äôt even masturbate and it came back with a vengeance two weeks later. I had heard about boric acid so I found this subreddit through my searches and decided, what would it hurt. The bottle of 30 capsules I got was $6. I inserted one every night for a week. Within three days there was no smell and my color had returned to light pink from red (which I haven‚Äôt seen in years). It‚Äôs been 3 weeks since my last dose and nothing has returned. 

TMI warning! 
I know this is probably graphic but my chronic bv sisters will understand why this is such a big deal. I masturbated recently and my toys smelled like NOTHING afterwards. Like literally smelled unused. I‚Äôm so happy and I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt try this years ago. If you‚Äôre dealing with bv, do yourself and your lady bits a favor and just TRY IT ALREADY. 

Also just a disclaimer....do some reading, but even if this is the only post you read, boric acid is safe for vaginal insertion but DO NOT TAKE IT ORALLY. It can cause kidney damage among other things. I had a slight discharge (some women have reported they had a ton while using boric acid) but no irritation or the horrible symptoms from antibiotics.

158xx3g,Healthyhooha,1690260225.0,"I (21 F) tought I had a yeast infection a few days ago. I used an over the counter three day treatment. It did help a bit but I was not fully healed. So yesterday I woke up and started to feel really bad. I called off work and went to an urgent care. I felt so bad I could barely focus when talking to the receptionist. It was the type of pain where you can barely sit still. After being seen by a nurse practitioner it turned out to be an UTI. The nurse practitioner said, ‚ÄúLooks like you have a pretty good UTI.‚Äù I was prescribed an antibiotic and something to help prevent a yeast infection.

Later the night I was using the restroom and felt what seemed like a tampon string. I than pulled out one. I was in shock. I had not used a tampon that day or even that week. I had no recollection of using a tampon in a long time. 
After a good hour of shock and this unnerving feeling of not trusting my own memory. I texted my boyfriend (22) about what just happened. 

The pieces started coming together. 
For context: I have never had a regular period. I was changing Birth-controlls. 

A little over a month ago (June 15-17)  my bf and I went on a camping trip with friends. This was the kind of drinking/getting high sort of camping. I had some break through bleeding from recently changing Birthcontrols. I used tampons during this trip. 

When we got back home and had sex he didn‚Äôt want to go down on me. He said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry but it smells‚Äù 

I understood and didn‚Äôt think much of it. I chopped it up to changing birth-control or something. Physically I felt fine. I also don‚Äôt have a good sense of smell period. So I wasn‚Äôt smelling what he was.

My bf and I have been having sex this past month. I have had some discomforts but didn‚Äôt think much of it. Until now it all makes sense. After I told him this and we put the pieces together he said, ‚Äúlast time I thought I felt something but sometimes I know you use those menstrual cups and don‚Äôt say anything so I though it was that‚Äù Which is true we will have sex while I am using a menstrual cup. I don‚Äôt always say something about it because I don‚Äôt want to ruin the moment.

okzqzx,WomensHealth,1626376482.0,"I get it. I truly cannot express to you how much I get it. I'm a forever recovering hypochondriac and getting this vaccine was really hard for me.

I get that it feels like it was rushed. I get that its difficult feeling like the government always has your best interest at heart (depending where you live.) Which is why I choose to listen to the doctors and the scientists and not politicians regarding the safety and efficacy of this vaccine. I'm mostly going to talk about the mRNA vaccines because I feel those are the ones people are most skeptical of.

And, a disclaimer here. I do not work in the medical field. I am simply trying to gather up the information we do have in one place and present it in a way that feels demystified. I feel confident the information here is accurate, but welcome any corrections because I'm only one lay person! And if you have any questions about what is presented here, or are still just curious or have doubts, I definitely encourage you to bring it up with your doctor!

**tl;dr - The COVID vaccines have gone through the exact same rigorous safety and efficacy evaluations as any other FDA approved drug. It's been able to move faster because it has been a priority to every government in the world, so massive amounts of resources and attention have been directed to their development, and have been moved to the top of the pile of drugs waiting for FDA evaluation and approval. Also, mRNA vaccines are a decades old technology and have been deployed in clinical trials for other viruses and some cancers years ago.**

**How these vaccines work**

A small piece of the virus's DNA sequence is essentially programed into a synthetic messenger RNA. mRNA works in our bodies to deliver instructions for what proteins to make. Our own mRNA and the synthetic stuff only lives in your body for a few days, and the proteins being produced are only produced for a few weeks.

So these vaccines deliver the instructions required for our own bodies to make the famous spike protein of the coronavirus. The vaccine itself is only in your body for a few days, and the spike proteins your body makes only last for a few weeks while your body figures out how to destroy the spike proteins. Then your body remembers this for next time it comes into contact with this, and similar, spike proteins. These are the antibodies (and T cells etc.)

**Regarding Efficacy**

The mRNA vaccines have been proven to be extremely effective at preventing COVID 19 and preventing severe disease. They are even being proven effective at preventing symptomatic disease with the variants, including Delta, though at a slightly less efficacy.

[https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2035389](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2035389)

Moderna's phase III trials of their original formulation showed a 94.1% efficacy at preventing disease, and nearly 100% effective at preventing severe disease. They recently came out saying their original formulation is still 93% effective 6 months later.

Pfizer showed in their phase III trials that their original formulation was 95% effective at protecting against symptomatic disease, and nearly 100% effective at preventing severe disease. These rates have also fallen, to being about 83.7% effective 6 months later.

[https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577)

I want to be clear though, these are still some of the most effective vaccines in history. For reference, the flu vaccine every year confers anywhere from 40-60% efficacy, but would be higher if more people got the flu vaccine.

I also want to address some people's worries about breakthrough infections. Most vaccines are actually formulated to prevent *disease,* not *infection.* Creating a vaccine that prevents infection is called 'sterilizing immunity' which is really hard to do, and few vaccines actually do that. We expect breakthrough infections to happen to some degree, and these are still some of the most protective vaccines in history. And again, the efficacy rate improves as more people get vaccinated.

That all being said, The Mayo Clinic just a released a pre peer reviewed study on the effectiveness of both vaccines on the Delta variant. It appears Pfizer's efficacy has dropped down to 42% and Moderna's to 76% in July when the Delta variant became the dominant variant. These results suggest the FDA may soon recommend boosters.

**Regarding Safety**

So here's where I think most people are finding issue. It feels like the vaccine was rushed, and I completely agree! It *feels* that way, but if we break down the whole process and everything leading up to this point, we can see all of these vaccines have gone through the exact same protocol as every other vaccine on the market.

1. To start with, mRNA vaccines are not new. We've been developing this technology for decades and have even previously deployed mRNA vaccines in clinical trials for other viruses such as Zika and cytomegalovirus, as well as certain cancers. Why those vaccines have not been FDA approved ultimately comes down to funding and demand.

[https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2017/01/zika-mrna-vaccine-enters-clinical-trial-angola-reports-cases](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2017/01/zika-mrna-vaccine-enters-clinical-trial-angola-reports-cases)

2. My next point is funding. COVID vaccine developers have been absolutely flooded with funding from governments around the world as well as individual donors, because everyone has a vested interest in ending this pandemic. Typically when scientists want to conduct research or develop a new technology, they need to take the time to apply for grants and approach investors to prove that the advancement is both needed and that their approach is viable. That was obviously not needed for these vaccines; we all agree they're needed and we've known mRNA vaccines are viable. Immediately having all the resources necessary is a huge boon for developers and pushes the timeline even faster.

3. And since everyone is interested in ending this pandemic, governments all over the world have temporarily relaxed typical protocols for sharing information across borders. (It would be cool if this were permanent but that's probably unlikely). Thousands of scientists all over the world dropped what they were doing and worked around the clock to come together to work on these vaccines. Normally it may just be like a dozen people in one country working towards an end goal, but with this free flowing information and collaborative effort, the timeline was again pushed faster.

4. We also have to remember technological advancement continues to accelerate. The technology we have now even compared to 10 years ago is immeasurable, and sequencing the entire genome of any organism takes no time at all. And since we already had the mRNA technology ready to go, it took almost no time to just plug in that chosen DNA sequence and get started on clinical trials. Truly, we had this vaccine basically ready to go, we just needed to sequence theDNA of SARS-CoV2 and choose an appropriate protein.

5. We also have been studying coronaviruses for over 50 years. Though SARS-CoV2 itself is a novel virus, its very similar to SARS-CoV1, which we have been studying since its outbreak in 2002, and could even use information from the MERS outbreak in 2012. Basically, we already understood this virus's structure, genome and lifecycle. It's not like we were starting from scratch.

**Clinical Trials and FDA approval**

So this brings me to clinical trials. Every single COVID vaccine (in the US) has to go through the exact same protocols as every other vaccine on the market today. No steps were skipped or rushed. The guidelines are as follows;

1. Pre Clinical Trials, where the vaccine is first tested on animals
2. A lab submits an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA, where the FDA reviews the results from the Pre Clinical Trials
3. Upon approval, a lab inspection is then scheduled and conducted to make sure the lab is in accordance to Good Laboratory Practices, a set of practices that has been established since the FDA's inception
4. The FDA also inspects the vaccines materials and the manufacturing technology for quality and safety
5. Phase 1 Clinical Trials: the vaccine is tested on 20-100 healthy adults for 2 months
6. Phase 2 Clinical Trials: based on the safety and efficacy shown in Stage 1, the vaccine is tested one hundreds more adults of varying health statuses and demographics for 2 months
7. Phase 3 Clinical Trials, where the vaccine is used on thousands of people where we can get an even better idea of common and rare side effects in the general population. this section is also 2 months long
8. The manufacturing process is again assessed to determine quality and safety of large scale production of the vaccine
9. Seeking Approval to distribute and market in the US. The benefits and risks of the vaccine are weighed, and the decision is reviewed by a team of experts including doctors, chemists, statisticians, manufacturing and facility experts, pharmacologists, toxicologists, microbiologists, experts in postmarketing safety, clinical study site inspectors, and labeling and communications experts. This is where we are now in waiting to get the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines FDA approved. Though this process needs to be reviewed by a lot of people, and that takes a lot of time, it is being prioritized right now
10. The FDA and respective labs continue to follow up with trial participants for years and the FDA regularly inspects and regulates the labs making the vaccine for quality, efficacy and safety

[https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/development-approval-process-cber/vaccine-development-101](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/development-approval-process-cber/vaccine-development-101)

**The vaccine was not rushed, it was** ***prioritized***

Much of the time historically spent getting vaccines developed and approved is more or less waiting time. There's all kinds of bureaucratic hoops to jump through, there's normally more obstacles by way of funding, information sharing, limited man power, and limited interest. Massive amounts of resources were simply funneled into this endeavor and developers aren't having to submit their applications to a long pile of other applications waiting to be approved. COVID vaccine development has been prioritized by everyone, so its just been moving through the technical and legal slog more quickly.

**What we know about vaccines**

So why is each phase of clinical trials 2 months long? Because we know it is *extremely* rare to experience vaccine side effects beyond 6-8 weeks. That is accepted as the rule, and any exceptions to that rule are so rare they are simply case studies. We have deployed mRNA vaccines years ago in trials for other viruses, and long term side effects have not been reported

[https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243)

It is also literally *impossible* for a vaccine to cause a side effect that the disease itself cannot cause, besides of course, allergy to a vaccine ingredient. COVID itself made me skip my period and then I had awful awful PMS symptoms for months after, and so far the COVID vaccine has made my period a bit irregular, but it is not forever. I have friends who are healthcare workers and got the vaccine in November, and their cycles have all returned to normal within 6 months. Any strong immune response or trauma can effect your menstrual cycle. Your reproductive system is meant to be adaptable, because you're body doesn't want you to get pregnant under stressful conditions. This isn't proven but if I had to guess, part of the reason our bodies are reacting in SUCH an inflammatory manner to COVID and the vaccines is because its a completely foreign invader. We haven't had regular exposures to this virus for our entire lifetime, so it has to deploy all weapons in its arsenal to figure out what works best. Most other pathogens, we've had some practice

We know the vaccine doesn't cause infertility because then we would be seeing COVID itself causing infertility. Which has not been the case.

Blood clots, Guillain Barre and heart inflammation are all rare side effects of the vaccine, but you're more likely to get them if you get COVID. Heck, you're more likely to get blood clots from your birth control than the vaccine.

**Conclusion**

I know that this likely isn't going to change anyone's minds who are vehemently anti-vax or anti-COVID vax. But I know some people are just nervous about the whole thing but *want* some more information and reassurance, so I hope this feels reassuring in some way. It's also unfortunate many of our governments havent been very communicative during this whole process and are now just expecting people to willingly put something that *feels* so foreign and unstudied in our bodies. Thankfully, we do actually know a lot about these vaccines and how theyre working in our bodies. And hopefully it is reassuring to know that these vaccines *have* gone through the exact same rigorous testing and evaluation as all other drugs on the (US) market.

iz11in,TwoXSupport,1600966642.0,"I'm 10 weeks pregnant and it's so infuriating to see the crap that men write on various pregnancy-related posts on some of the bigger subreddits (AITA, relationship\_advice, etc.). I know that these subreddits can be shitty toxic places, but whenever I see a post related to pregnancy, I can't help but get a little curious as to what people are saying on it, and sure enough, it's almost always cis men who know nothing about what it's like to be pregnant or have a child judging a pregnant woman.

Did anybody else see the post on AITA a week or two ago where people were saying that the OP wasn't the asshole when he froze his pregnant wife's credit card (literally committing financial abuse) because she was ordering sushi and Subway off of meal delivery services to satisfy cravings, and he believed that since her (male!) doctor said no sushi or deli meats, she was behaving like horribly irresponsible child and needed to be controlled? It was horrifying to see how many men agreed with this guy and were so vehemently opposed even considering the opinions that women were posting in defense of the pregnant wife (including that the doctor's advice is outdated and that it's all about deciding what you consider too risky based on actual data, not knee jerk reactions like ""OMG SUSHI IS BAD. YOU'LL KILL BABY IF YOU EAT HAM."") I mean really, who knows more about pregnancy, men who have never been pregnant (most of whom haven't even had a pregnant partner) or women who have been pregnant? Why would you even argue? Driving is far more risky for a pregnant woman and her baby than having a Subway sandwich! Hell, I bet that data would be in favor of the statement that being in a relationship with a man is more risky for a pregnant woman than a Subway sandwich based on how common it is for domestic violence to start to happen or ramp up during or directly after pregnancy.

A lot of women brought up the book ""Expecting Better"" by Emily Oster, which is a book that I've found very helpful in determining what risks I'm willing to take in pregnancy so I can still feel like an autonomous human and not like an incubator (something that my husband is 100% in support of. He understands that it's my body and I'm an adult who's able to make safe, well-informed decisions for myself and our child), and a bunch of men would jump on them and point out the Oster is ""aN eCoNoMiSt, NoT a DoCtOr"", so nobody should listen to her. Oster clearly states that she's an economist, not a doctor, and the whole point of the book is that she's an economist who's great at research, so she presents the research and data related to these topics to make women more informed about how risky certain things are so they can make their own well-informed decisions. I may not be a doctor, but I know how to do my own research and make my own well-informed decisions, thank you very much.

There was also that AITA post from a few days ago where a woman's husband had been unemployed due to COVID and was the primary caregiver for their young child when he suddenly started ""just having a feeling"" (literally, no other evidence to speak of) that his son wasn't his and requesting a paternity test from her despite the son clearly being his. There were men saying that SHE was gaslighting HIM by telling him that she would only consider getting the test if he went to therapy, because she was concerned that he was having a mental health crisis (which makes complete sense since this was coming from out of left field and a total shift in personality). They wouldn't even admit that it was alright for this woman to feel hurt and offended that her husband was essentially claiming that she had cheated and is committing paternity fraud. Absolutely ridiculous.

Has anybody else noticed this trend and does it piss anybody else off?

Thank you for letting me vent!

  
EDIT TO ADD: ALSO, to all of the posts about men who seem to be acting strangely after their wife gives birth: No, cis men by definition CANNOT have postpartum depression.

I was terrified and thought I was the rare unlucky person to get an STD without ever having had sex. My mom always came in the doctors office with me and I was too scared to bring it up. Finally, one day I got to go to the doctor by myself. I was nervous but forced myself to ask about it because these suckers were HUGE. They were recurring and would fill up with pus and blood. Itchy, painful, and then they would burst. After bursting the wound remained open which was even more painful because my undies would rip the scabs as they formed. 

At that time, my doctor told me to take baths mixed with a little bit of bleach and ordered me an ointment (clindamyacin) to help them heal faster.


As I got older, the severity of the bumps/boils/carbuncles decreased dramatically but the frequency did not. I get them all the time now, on my labia majora as well as my inner thighs (the ones on my inner thighs don‚Äôt burst and they are hard. They slowly go away). 

It‚Äôs really frustrating and uncomfortable and embarrassing sometimes. I have never really found a solution or help for this issue. As a matter of fact, I was today years old when I found out it had a name: Hidradenitis suppurativa. The only reason I know that is from this sub!!

t0ttzx,WomensHealth,1645760206.0,"I (26f, US) found out 9 years ago that I had a small 1.7cm nodule on my thyroid. I immediately had it biopsied and it was benign. I was advised by my PCP that I should have it removed at some point to avoid the risk of cancer in the future. I had met with a surgeon who retired before my second appointment. My next surgeon retired before my first appointment. We were having trouble finding another surgeon so my PCP advised I just have regular ultrasounds done in order to keep an eye on it.

I had ultrasounds every 3 years or so and began seeing an ENT/Surgeon a year ago. My ultrasound last year showed that my nodule had grown to 4cm and that I had another large one at 2.8cm and multiple other small ones all over my thyroid. The ultrasound also showed that my nodules had become solid while they were previously fluid-filled.

I asked my ENT if he would remove the nodules. Based on their rapid growth and my trouble breathing, it seemed like the logical answer. He denied my request and stated that my thyroid hormone levels from my recent blood work was normal so surgery would be unnecessary. I pushed him and said that I would like to have the surgery before I was removed from my parent's no-deductible insurance plan in a year. He told me that ""losing your insurance isn't a reason to have a surgery.""

I thought to my myself: funny, maybe it isn't a reason for YOU and the funds you have. For the rest of us who don't have a disposable income and live in this medical debt hellscape that is the US, it can sometimes be the only chance we'll get to have proper medical care.

He prescribed speech therapy for my breathing problems and that I get an ultrasound and come back in a year. The speech therapist found nothing wrong with my vocal chords and agreed that he probably prescribed it to satiate my request for care. 

Fast forward to now, I had my yearly ultrasound and my nodules have grown again. I have one 4.6cm, 3.8cm and multiple 1-2cm nodules. Again my ENT did not see any issue. I had to beg him just to prescribe a biopsy this time. The results came back and what would you know, I have a high chance of having thyroid cancer! My ENT read the results and said that malignancy is likely.

I met with him again a few days ago to discuss surgery, which he finally wants to do of course. I asked him about the cost  and he told me not to worry about it; that insurance would cover it. I reminded him that my insurance with my parent ends on the 1st and that my new insurance with work has a 4k deductible. He scoffed and said, ""well you'll definitely be meeting your deductible with this surgery!""

I'm not too worried about the cancer, everything I've read says that thyroid cancer is very treatable. I'm just extremely stressed about the medical debt I'm going to be saddled with all because my doctor wouldn't listen to me a year ago. I am going to a hospital nearby that specializes in cancer care to discuss having my surgery there. I tried advocating for myself and my health but my doctor continuously wrote me off.

odf4a0,Periods,1625381674.0,"I started my period when I was 12 and I‚Äôm 42 now. Here are some things I‚Äôve learned. I hope it‚Äôs helpful to someone. This is just my experience and my point of view, and I know not everyone will be able to follow this advice because of their life circumstances.¬≠¬≠ If anyone else has any tips I'd love to hear them.

&#x200B;

1. If over-the-counter painkillers are not enough to make your periods pain-free, talk to a doctor ‚Äì more than one if need be. When I was young, doctors told me that period pain was part of being a woman. I wish I‚Äôd told them that treating pain is part of being a doctor. It wasn‚Äôt until I was 27 that I was prescribed proper pain relief ‚Äì first of all Mefenamic Acid and now Naproxen (I‚Äôm in the UK). If I take them at the right time, my periods can be almost pain-free.
2. Stress creates tension in the body, which can worsen pain. My period pain is a very sensitive barometer of how stressed I am, e.g. my pain is always worse if I‚Äôm at work rather than at home in bed. The day I move city I had some of the worst period pain of my life, and sometimes if I feel myself getting stressed about something, I can feel my period pain getting worse at the same time. If you get bad period pain, it might be worth thinking about what you can do to make your life less stressful or even stress-free. Everyone‚Äôs different but here were some of the things I did to reduce my stress: running, meditation, working part-time, working from home, moving to the countryside, having therapy.
3. Prepare for your period. This is an easy way to take some of the hassle out of periods. Devote a drawer or shelf to period paraphernalia and make sure you always have plenty of painkillers, tampons/sanitary towels, pants, heat pads, chocolate, magazines ‚Äì whatever you need to get through it. If you know your period is due, sleep on a towel for a couple of nights ‚Äì having to wash your sheets is going to make you resent your period even more. If your period is regular and painful, keep your diary as clear as possible for the days when you are likely to be in pain.
4. When you‚Äôre in pain, you need to take care of yourself. It doesn‚Äôt matter that it‚Äôs ‚Äújust‚Äù your period, that it happens every month, that some other women‚Äôs periods are easy. A body in pain needs care. If you want to cancel social plans, do it ‚Äì no guilt, you are in pain. I‚Äôve called in sick to every job I‚Äôve ever had because of period pain and my managers have only ever been sympathetic. I‚Äôm in the UK and I know some countries are less tolerant of sick leave, but if your manager wants you to work when you‚Äôre in pain (which will probably make your pain worse) think about whether you want to work for them. If you live with someone and it feels appropriate, ask them to help you: to bring you a hot drink or a hot water bottle or to make dinner.
5. It‚Äôs commonly said that pain x resistance = suffering. In other words, the more we resist our pain, the more we suffer. I agree with this because I experience it every month with my period. If I tense up against my pain, get angry with it, hate it, try to push it away, thrash around, scream and shout, it makes the pain much worse. If I‚Äôm able to stop resisting it and relax my body, the pain lessens. If I‚Äôm able to take it one step further and embrace the pain (so, the opposite of resisting) it lessens even more. By embracing it I mean that I imagine the pain like a visitor that I‚Äôm welcoming and embracing. It sounds odd but it‚Äôs a well-known method of pain management - it's just very hard to do.
6. There is still a lot of taboo and secrecy around periods, which makes having a period infinitely harder. Try being honest with people when you cancel plans/call in sick and say it‚Äôs because of your period, rather than making something up. If people hear it enough times from enough people it will stop being taboo and we can all relax a little more instead of having to pretend that periods don‚Äôt exist.
7. PMS (mood swings and other symptoms in the week or two before your period) can also be exacerbated by stress. My personal experience is that hormones + stress = PMS. If you experience bad PMS and you feel your moods are out of control, again it might be worth looking into ways to reduce stress in your life. I used to get extreme PMS, because I was extremely stressed, and since I made the changes listed above I rarely experience PMS, and if I do I can usually pinpoint what's stressing me. Remember you don‚Äôt have to have a high-powered job or seven kids to be stressed ‚Äì some of us find ordinary life very stressful.
8. Periods are crap but they can teach us a lot about self-care. Every month our period challenges us to take care of ourselves ‚Äì can we do it? Can we admit that we‚Äôre suffering and let ourselves rest? Can we put ourselves first, even for just a few days? Can we be honest with people and ask for help? Self-care is extremely difficult for some of us, but it‚Äôs one of the most important life skills we can learn.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Periods/comments/odf4a0/what_ive_learned_from_30_years_of_periods/,What I've learned from 30 years of periods,Discussion,221,30,1.0,Youknowkitties

For the past 6 months I have started to suffer from repeated bv, yeast infections, and UTIs that sometimes had no symptoms. After seeing different gynecologists and getting no answers on why this was happening to me, I made an appointment with a urogynecologist. They took a direct sample of my urine via catheter, and while he was examining me asked me if I ever had a baby and if I‚Äôm on bc. Apparently I have discoloration from a vaginal tear. 

He said that bc I‚Äôve been on birth control for 6 years without stopping, my estrogen is extremely low and that‚Äôs what has been causing the urethra discomfort and vaginal discomfort and tearing from sex. Apparently that can also make you prone to UTIs because it thins the skin of the urethra. 

I am to get off birth control for 3 months, and apply an estrogen cream 3 times a week. Also boric acid for a month for the infections.

The infection started when I was in eighth grade, I just graduated college AND I AM STILL DEALING WITH THIS FUCKING THING. I seriously think after this many years and different treatments that my vagina is ruined. Infertile at the very least. I have tried so many different treatments, from antibiotics to probiotic suppositories to boric acid (which is what I have been using for the past seven years so that I can live a semi-normal life). All the regular advice I have heard a million times, no douching, cotton underwear, don‚Äôt let a guy cum inside. The smell always comes back. I didn‚Äôt even lose my virginity until I was 21 and have only had sex twice in my entire life, a big part of the reason being because of this. I am pretty sure I will never be able to get a boyfriend because of this also, like how do I explain this to a guy? Anyway, to keep symptoms at bay I regularly use boric acid which is something else I have to worry about because I don‚Äôt know the long-term side effects and I am so scared I am going to get cancer down the road from sticking boric acid up my vagina for literally the past seven years. It is the only thing that will get rid of symptoms overnight! Even though it come back within 1-2 days.

Sorry for the rant, I have just been realizing lately that I am probably going to be miserably dealing with this for the rest of my life. I haven‚Äôt even really lived life yet. I can‚Äôt do things spontaneously like take road trips or have sex. I am so fucking scared that I am going to get cancer from the boric acid and that I may be alone for the rest of my life because no one wants to date a girl with a broken & smelly vagina. I just wish this hadn‚Äôt happened to me. I visited a gynecologist recently and she has prescribed me a course of vaginal metronidazole that I am going to use following my next period, followed by insertion of a probiotic suppository every night. She also prescribed me long term metronidazole to take 1-2 times a week after my initial course. I can‚Äôt get my hopes up but it‚Äôs the best option I have right now.

I don‚Äôt even know what I am looking for with posting this. I can‚Äôt really talk to anyone in my life about it and I know recurrent BV is a big problem on this sub, so I thought maybe you guys might listen to me. Anybody have any similar problems or fears? Anyone else get the feeling they might be stuck with this for their entire life? I don't know how much more of this I can take.

lkh3si,Healthyhooha,1613406529.0,"I‚Äôm writing this post in hopes my story can help other women that may have not considered this as being a cause of their chronic vulvovaginitis (irritated, itchy, raw, burning vulva and vagina).

On Jan 1, my partner and I had intercourse and he did his business inside me, which we usually try to avoid since his semen can cause me to be itchy for a few hours. Jan 2, I woke up still itchy and now what was a burning sensation in my vagina, around my urethra, inner labia, and mild burning while urinating.

Long story short, I went to 3 doctors over the course of several weeks who only prescribed Diflucan and Terconazole cream for a yeast infection, but didn‚Äôt do any tests. It was an assumption on their part. Finally got in to my gyno who swabbed me, in which I came back positive for e. Coli and G. vaginalis. I was treated with Ampicillin for the e. Coli, and Tinidazole for BV. By end of Jan, all meds and treatments were totally done but I was STILL having a raw irritating feeling on the inner part of my vulva, and inside my vagina. My gyno told me the meds should have worked and she wasn‚Äôt sure what else could be causing it and basically blew me off. It hurt to touch, wear pants, walk, you name it. At this point I thought I was doomed and was going to be stuck like this forever. I started obsessively eliminating all things from my life including detergent, soaps, any scented items, toilet paper, all fruits, all sugar, all dairy. And still, I was in so much discomfort. Beginning of Feb, I was tested again and everything came back NEGATIVE. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I thought that for sure I was going to have vulvodynia at this point since we‚Äôve ruled everything else out.

So, I saw a new gyno. After she examined me she said everything looked normal with the exception of some redness and dryness and suggested we treat this as a skin condition rather than a vaginal condition or infection. Did another swab and again, everything negative. She said that it‚Äôs possible that all of the meds I had been taking have caused my skin to go haywire. She recommended I go home and increase the humidity in my house, avoid long hot showers, drink at least 9 glasses of water each day, avoid salty foods and coffee/caffeine and wear underwear at all times rather than go without (as I have been doing thinking everything needed to air out). I also went and got a humidifier and CRANKED that thing up.

Low and behold, 24 hours later I felt almost 100% back to normal. It turns out all of the symptoms I was feeling were from DRY SKIN! 

I know this won‚Äôt be the case with everyone on here but I hope this is something that can give some ladies hope if they haven‚Äôt ruled this out yet. The symptoms felt IDENTICAL to that of a yeast infection or BV and was impossible to pinpoint since I did have an actual infection in the beginning, and kept thinking the meds surely just didn‚Äôt work.

So, ladies, if you are experiencing some irritation down there and your tests keep coming back negative, I encourage you to stop taking medications temporarily, add a probiotic, increase water intake and try to do anything to alleviate dry skin as possible. This is especially the case if you are already predisposed to severely dry skin on your whole body like I am. It‚Äôs quite likely if you‚Äôve been on so many abx or using creams to treat infections, it‚Äôs totally drying you out to the point where it‚Äôs causing you a whole separate problem. At least this was the case with me, and I would hate to have anyone else suffer the same way since ultimately I had to advocate for myself to come to this conclusion.


TLDR; If you are struggling to find the cause of irritation, burning, or itchiness of your vulva, and tests come back negative, try treating it as a dry skin issue instead of infection.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/lkh3si/chronic_vaginal_irritationitchiness_may_just_be/,Chronic vaginal irritation/itchiness may just be severely dry and irritated skin!,,219,56,1.0,Unusual-Telephone-87

wptk3b,Periods,1660654329.0,"I hear a lot of people saying they hate pads and pads suck. While I do like tampons because I don't have to feel them in my pants all day, here's why I prefer pads sometimes:

1. They don't leak. My tampons leak ALL THE TIM. I've tried different sizes, putting them in differently, but inevitably some blood is going to end up in my underwear. That doesn't happen with pads.
2. I can tell when to change them. With tampons, I can usually guess pretty accurately, but it's not like I can look inside my vagina and see if it's time to replace my tampon. With pads, I can just look down.
3. They're softer. Sometimes, shoving cotton up my vagina and pulling it out when it's filled with blood feels a bit uncomfortable. No such problem with pads.
4. I can feel the blood coming out when I use pads. This is a bit weird, but sometimes I like being able to feel my period as it happens. Is that so wrong?

lgj91l,Healthyhooha,1612922206.0,"I must first acknowledge that I am so lucky to have a doctor who went the extra mile and did some research to help me. I had serious vaginal atrophy. Tearing with something as simple as a LUBRICATED SPECULUM being inserted. I had been bleeding, tearing, and in awful amounts of pain during sex since late august of 2020. I had seen 6-7 different doctors, all who misdiagnosed me. They chalked up the actual fissures to be result of a UTI, then a Yeast Infection, then BV, then BV again, then to just needing desitin. None of those things were my problem. I wasted money, physical pain, mental exhaustion, and precious time I could‚Äôve been using to bang my man for MONTHS. 

All because one doctor actually gave a shit. She thought maybe my hormonal birth control was causing these issues. Hormonal BC essentially puts your body itself into ‚Äúmenopause‚Äù because your body stops producing its normal amounts of hormones. This can cause vaginal dryness, sensitivity, atrophy of the tissues, and in rare cases (like mine) vaginal tearing. Birth control induced vulvodynia is REAL.

I got off the pill immediately, and I started to apply a specially prescribed cream with estrogen and testosterone to speed up the healing process. Two weeks in, I had to just try it out with my boyfriend. I wasn‚Äôt supposed to but we had basically not had enjoyable sex since the fall. 

Sure enough, I was WET (haven‚Äôt been able to get wet in years), absolutely ZERO pain, best experience ever.

I am so happy. Consider dropping your hormonal birth control and finding a different method if you‚Äôve been having chronic pain/tearing and dryness during sex!

d4dem0,Healthyhooha,1568506975.0,"Botched labiaplasties are common due to a lack of training standards and pervasive ignorance of anatomy. Most surgeons doing these procedures are, quite simply, doing surgeries they are not trained to do on anatomy they do not know well. 

Even experts like Miklos and Pelosi can be found misinforming patients about basic anatomy on RealSelf. This should be seen as a major red flag. 

In nearly every account I see of botched labiaplasties, I see women blaming themselves.
Self-blame has been present in nearly every story I get privately sent from other patients who have been hurt. And today I am seeing more self-blame on Reddit.

Example 1:
‚ÄúI almost feel like it‚Äôs the punishment I deserve for not being able to love my body in the first place. I feel like I don‚Äôt ever deserve to be happy again or enjoy sex.‚Äù

Example 2:
‚ÄúI‚Äôve spent thousands [‚Ä¶] to try to fix this problem that I pretty much created for myself.‚Äù

Women blame themselves for being vain, for choosing the wrong surgeon, etc. This is incredibly frustrating to me, knowing what I know about the field of female genital cosmetic surgery.

First of all, there are no training standards for labiaplasty, and neither OB/GYNs nor plastic surgeons are trained to do these procedures in residency.

Secondly, detailed surgical anatomy of the vulva, vulvar physiology, and vulvar biomechanics are generally missing from both OB/GYN and plastic surgery literature.

Compare getting a labiaplasty to getting a rhinoplasty (nose job). If you go to a board certified plastic surgeon for a nose job, you know your surgeon has been trained in rhinoplasty during their plastic surgery residency. You know they have performed this procedure under supervision during their training, and that they have received detailed instruction in techniques. You additionally can rest assured that they have detailed knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the nose.

But with labiaplasty, you have none of these assurances. Getting a labiaplasty with your average board certified OB/GYN or plastic surgeon is like getting a rhinoplasty with a dermatologist. Is there a dermatologist out there who can perform rhinoplasty safely? I‚Äôm sure there is. But if you go to a dermatologist for a rhinoplasty, there are almost no safeguards in place to ensure your doctor is qualified.

Female genital cosmetic surgery has been controversial. For that reason, regulatory bodies, especially in OB/GYN, have not wanted to be involved in ensuring high standards of care. For example, while the American College of OB/GYNs approves these surgeries for medical reasons, they refuse to cooperate in the establishment of training standards.

Meanwhile, at surgery centers, privileging policies are typically in place to keep surgeons from performing surgeries they have not been trained to do. Going back to the rhinoplasty example, no surgery center would allow a dermatologist to perform a rhinoplasty. However, they will grant privileges to do labiaplasties to OB/GYNs and plastic surgeons who have never been trained to do labiaplasties.

What people need to understand is this all amounts to systemic negligence. As long as women keep blaming themselves instead of directing blame at those actually responsible, this will not change.

Currently, victims of this systemic negligence are invisible, as outcome studies are only published by experts with significant experience. While surgeons tell me they see many patients who have been severely harmed, these patients essentially do not exist in the female genital cosmetic surgery literature.

What laypeople need to understand is those who do publish FGCS outcome studies do so to promote their practices. Only surgeons with great outcomes and a large sample of patents have the incentive and ability to publish. There is meanwhile no incentive to publish bad outcomes unless there is money to made in repairs. As a result, the evidence basis for FGCS is not representative of the standard of care the average patient receives.

Personally, I suffered a dorsal nerve injury in a clitoral hood reduction performed without my consent during a labiaplasty. In my efforts to protect other patients from harm, I have done a dissection study with my plastic surgeon father, which we submitted to the Aesthetic Surgery Journal.

Though the potential for injury is clear, and though ignorance of the innervation of the clitoris is consistently demonstrated in OB/GYN and plastic surgery literature, the editors of the Aesthetic Surgery Journal question whether dorsal nerve injuries are a problem.

It is notable that when I consulted with one of the biggest FGCS experts in the country, he had no explanation for how I could have lost sensation. In order for me to know I suffered from a dorsal nerve injury, I had to do my own research, teach myself the anatomy, diagnose myself, and then find a doctor qualified to confirm it. How many patients diagnose themselves?

To those still blaming themselves, your botched labiaplasty was not your fault. And if you want to protect future patients, speak up. Healthy sexual function is a human right.

qe7w12,WomensHealth,1635005797.0,"I am making this post as a cautionary tale of my (30f) health experience in the hopes that this will encourage others to get vaccinated for HPV if they are not already so they can hopefully avoid what I am currently going through. I hope this is alright with the mod team, but if not I will understand if this post is removed.

When the HPV vaccine first came out I was right at or just above the cutoff age for it to be administered, which iirc was between 10-13. My parents at the time chose not to have me vaccinated for it because they were unsure of side effects from a brand new treatment. A few years ago the vaccine was approved for people into their 20s, and I had wanted to get it then but I was once again above the cutoff age. 

I mention this because of events playing out for me now: two months ago I went into a clinic after I moved for a job to get prescription refills. I didn't remember when my last pap smear had been done so when it was offered I agreed to a pelvic exam and all the rest. 

Well, that pap smear came back positive for HPV, as well as some abnormal cells that needed further investigation. Fearing cancer, I agreed to a colposcopy at the end of September. Samples were taken at four different places on and inside of my cervix where there was abnormal cell growth, and the doctor who administered that procedure informed me that the HPV vaccine was now available to women under age 45, and that while it was obviously too late to prevent the HPV I have now, it could prevent other types of HPV, So I agreed to start the vaccination rounds. I would get test results from my colposcopy a week later. 

That anxious week later I was told that, thankfully, I did not have cervical cancer. However, the abnormalities in my cervix were severe enough to be considered pre-cancerous and would need to be removed through a procedure called a LEEP, which is an acronym (iirc) for Looped Electrical Excision Procedure. A thin wire powered up with electricity is used to cut away the abnormal tissues and simultaneously cauterize the wounds. It can remove pre-cancer and could have been the end of this whole mess, but it's also partly diagnostic to check if further action must be taken.

I say *could have*, because unfortunately for me I learned that my cell abnormalities are high enough in my cervix that I now need to have a cone biopsy to remove the rest. A LEEP can be done in an OB/GYN clinic, but a cone biopsy is a surgical procedure that must be done at a hospital. I will be having this done 2-3 weeks from now. It will remove more tissue from my cervix, but I will heal from it and my cervix and uterus will remain in tact. 

Had I not gone in and had that pap smear two months ago, I might be telling a very different story today. I am *so glad* that I trusted my gut and went through all of this, and the doctors and nurses working with me have all been supportive and wonderful. In spite of all of this, I can't help but sigh and think about how this chain of events could have been *completely* avoided if I had gotten vaccinated for HPV as a pre-teen. 

So with all told, this is my call to action: if you are under 45 and have not gotten the HPV vaccine, please get the HPV vaccine. If you have sons and daughters, please get them vaccinated for HPV when you can. You will be saving them a lot of anxiety and heartache in the future. And regardless, please get your regularly scheduled pap smears, pelvic exams, etc. from your OB/GYN or other qualified care provider. This can literally save your life!

occasionally after sex, I would get cramps so bad they‚Äôd shoot down into both of my legs. figured it was deep penetration and nothing more.

woke up last week in the middle of the night in screaming pain. my obgyn is the best, agreed to see me first thing in the morning. She discovered I had a 12.5 cm ovarian cyst twisting on my right ovary and migrating to the left. i was taken in for emergency surgery by her colleague. 

it was the worst pain i‚Äôve ever felt in all my life. i screamed at the top of my lungs even though i was on the strongest pain medicine possible. I screamed the whole time until they put me under.

through c-section, they had to remove my right ovary and fallopian tube and of course, the cyst. They were able to drain and save the left ovary, so if i want to, i can still have kids with one ovary.

my point is, if you think something is wrong, do not hesitate to ask for an ultrasound. and do not listen to your general physicians if they are not listening to you. she was insisting i wasn‚Äôt having ovarian problems, just digestive and gallbladder issues. 

I‚Äôm just so thankful for my obgyn who caught the cyst in time, the surgeon who saved my life, and my boyfriend who i had by my side the entire time. he stayed in the hospital every night i was there and continued to help care for me at home. I am truly so grateful for him and his kindness.

Last month I had my paraguard IUD removed because of recurring BV. I had my IUD for 6 years. At some point it broke into two pieces!! The smaller pieces is still stuck inside me and I now have to have a laparoscopy to find it. My Dr said it might be in my fallopian tube and if it is they will have to remove that fallopian tube to get it. 

Luckily, I don't live in the US anymore and I won't be financially ruined by this operation. But I'm pissed. This bs doesn't seem to end.

zna8fn,WomensHealth,1671180966.0,"A hairball took me to the ER tonight. I've been breaking out in hives since Monday and have been smelling... questionable intermittently for a few months. This isn't because I'm cool with being stinky, but because no tests were coming back positive for anything unusual. My blood work, bv tests, std tests were all *totally* fine. So, frustrated asf, I continued smelling like a used bandaid and had no idea what to do about it. 

The obvious thing would have been to get a pelvic exam, but I only went to urgent care. Between appointments being booked out for months and a husband with cancer, I kept putting it off.

While ruminating, I started thinking about those horror stories where people lose tampons in their vag. That got me anxious enough to feel around, and the only thing out of place was what I previously assumed to be tangled IUD strings.

This led me to reading about rare cases of hair getting caught in the strings, which fit the texture perfectly. Gross. 

So today, after having constant hives, bad cramps, and smelling worse than ever, I went to the ER. I could tell the attending PA didn't believe my hair theory. After the examination, he called the oncall gynecologist for advice on proceeding, and I overheard him saying ""I've never seen this before either"". I feel so special. 

 I lost my 7 year old Paraguard, but hopefully with the help of antibiotics my body will stop being/smelling like an ass. Still waiting on the rest of the tests to come back, including a culture on the icky ""foreign object"".

She did a swap and she also inserted some tools to look inside. Both of which were extremely painful. 

She then said she wants to do a deep disinfection of my vagina then give me a skin cream to put inside for a while. According to her, she had a patient with yeast infections for a year and she got rid of it with this deep disinfection. 

I had never heard of this before and it sounded weird.

There are more tests that can be run for our vaginas that doctors don‚Äôt always offer. For example, there is a full spectrum yeast test that tests for more than just candida albicans. If you are having mystery problems down there, ask for this! Also ask for a BV test, mycoplasma and ureaplasma tests.

If your doctor denies, push the issue. Tell them to note in your chart that they denied you testing. You would be surprised how they can change their minds.

Learn how to use a speculum on yourself and at appointments, insert it yourself. If the doctor does not allow you to do this, time to get a new doctor.

Every time I go in for a gynecological appointment I insert my own speculum, and it is a powerful thing to do. 

I just had a full spectrum yeast test (am waiting for results) and had to ask for it specifically, even though my gyno knew I was in discomfort and all other tests were showing negative. My gyno also does not think genital mycoplasma/ureaplasma is a problem but she still did the test (negative thank god) because I demanded it.

Advocate for yourself and do not back down! I know it can be uncomfortable but so can 5 months of genital itching.

Was I wrong to leave class without permission and bleed on my science teachers seat?

I am a freshman in highschool. I was in science, with a male teacher. We were learning about punnet squares, and things like that.

I wasn't expecting my period to come for another two weeks, but I guess it's still irregular, especially since I just stated a few months ago, because all of the sudden, I got really bad cramps and felt a little weird.

I waited until the video we were watching was over and for him to pass out our assignment. I went up to his desk and asked him to go to the restroom. He said, no, and told me to finish the assignment. Luckily, I understood the assignment pretty well, so I finished it quickly. I went up to him again and asked him to go to the restroom. He said ""No. You didn't finish the assignment."" When I told him I did, he said to stop lying and sent me back to my seat.

I pretended to write on the paper for a little and went BACK up to him. At this point, my classmates were snickering. I showed him the paper and asked him to go to the restroom, and he said ""No. You lied about finishing the paper, so you're lying about needing to go to the bathroom. I told him they were ""female hygiene issues"" but he still said no. So I went back to the seat, and I bled through. I asked my friend for her sweatshirt, went up to the teacher, frustrated and didn't care about being polite at this point, and said ""I bled on your seat, I'm going to the bathroom, bye."" I took my backpack with me, because I always bring an extra pair of pants. My mom has told me way too many of her ""period in public"" stories.

When I was done, class was over and the next class had started. My science teacher caught me in the hallway and said ""You should've held your plop in. Now your blood is on my seat, and I am not cleaning it up."" He then proceeded to give me detention.

AITA for leaving class without permission and bleeding on his seat?

I'm scared to tell my mom, because I know she'll be mad that I didn't have courage to get up and leave the first time.

x7fn2j,WomensHealth,1662483426.0,"Warning: TMI 
I‚Äôm a very healthy, active 23-year old and don‚Äôt have any history of painful vaginal experiences. But over a week ago, I felt this extremely painful feeling on my bottom. I assumed it was due to my butt, considering I‚Äôve had problems with hemorrhoids in the last few years. 

Except it wasn‚Äôt my butt at all. I noticed it was so painful to sit down so I went to look in the mirror and sure enough, there was a small lump near the bottom of my left labia. I didn‚Äôt think much of it, assuming it would go away on its own. I even took ibuprofen which helped tremendously for 5 days. But once that wore off, the pain was a lot to endure. 

I still managed to go about my day performing regular activities, even going for runs. 

But one night, suddenly the pain became UNBEARABLE. I could not sleep all night. My bump has grown SO big, spreading through my entire labia and even covering my hole. Based on my research, I saw that it was something called Bartholin Cyst but still wasn‚Äôt 100% sure. At that point, 4 ibuprofens were not doing me justice. That morning, I got out of bed barely able to walk, sit or just move in general. 

My husband took me to this emergency after-hours clinic. We waited for 3 hours while I was on the verge of passing out from the pain. Finally, the doctor came in and touched around the area. She told me, ‚ÄúI am so sorry but I am not comfortable performing an incision on you. It is‚Ä¶very extensive and deep. I don‚Äôt want to do something that will make it worse. So, I‚Äôm going to refer you to the hospital next door.‚Äù 

One hour later, I‚Äôm at the hospital, crying in so much pain. The doctor touched the area, said I had an infection (called an abscess) and performed an ultrasound to see if it needed to be drained or if I could get away with just antibiotics.  

One look at that ultrasound and she said, ‚ÄúOh yeah. This needs to be drained right away. We‚Äôre going to need do an incision.‚Äù 

At this point, I didn‚Äôt care what they had to do. I just wanted the pain to be over. 

The doctor first had to numb my vagina. That. Part. Was. The. Most. Painful. Experience. In. My. Entire. Life. The doctor even sent the nurse to get more numbing injections because of how big it was. I was crying so hard, squeezing the life out of my husband‚Äôs hand. 

Then it went numb. They performed the incision. I didn‚Äôt feel anything but this SIGNIFICANT amount of pressure. My husband‚Äôs eyes went wide and I just saw puddles of puss come out. 

They put me on antibiotics and told me to do sitz baths (which helps tremendously). I‚Äôve been wearing pads too to help with the drainage. 

I feel significantly better now, despite the amount of blood I lost. But it needed to be done. I pray it never happens again.

ldus6r,WomensHealth,1612606059.0,"UPDATE BELOW!

I‚Äôve been on the combination pill for almost a decade now, and decided this month that I‚Äôve had enough of it. I started the pill almost as soon as I started my period to help with cramping and acne. I switched to the Mirena IUD at one point a couple years ago just to try it out and got the worst acne of my life. Being back on the pill helped get things back to normal skin wise, but then I plateaued and have been dealing with a decent bit of acne that won‚Äôt go away, but it doesn‚Äôt bother me.

My biggest reason for getting off the pill is suffering from low libido and insane dryness to a point where I knew my marriage was suffering. I started getting anxious about sex and even masturbation because it would sting and occasionally bleed because I was so dry. No lube was enough to make my vagina just feel ready for sex and it was awful. I never wanted sex physically, but always mentally and it was taking a huge toll on my marriage and my confidence.

It‚Äôs only been about three weeks since getting off and I haven‚Äôt gotten my first ‚Äúoff the pill‚Äù period yet but I don‚Äôt even care how miserable it might be. Nearly the next day after getting off the pill, I was full blown WAP. I craved sex more then I ever had, everything my husband does turns me on, I‚Äôm actually wet again from just thinking about sex, and I stay wet all through sex. There‚Äôs zero pain, zero tearing, zero anxiety. I feel more confident in myself, I have more energy, I just feel happier and lighter.

I obviously haven‚Äôt been off long enough to really see how this plays out, especially with my skin and my period, but to me it‚Äôs all worth it. I feel like myself for the first time in so long. I‚Äôll update as the rest of the month plays out, and I‚Äôm fully expecting lots of changes, but if I can keep even a tiny bit of this bliss, it‚Äôs so worth it.


UPDATE:

So I‚Äôm officially almost two months off the pill. Still very happy with my choice to get off. My first period was almost exactly how it was on the pill, which was interesting to me because I got on originally for awful cramps and acne. But my flow was maybe a tiny bit heavier, and the cramps on day one were definitely worse, but not at all debilitating.

However! I got a yeast infection once my period finished up which I‚Äôve never experienced before. It cleared up just fine with some Monistat, but that definitely sucked and was different. I read that your first period of BC can just be a withdrawal period and not be very intense, so next period may be different. But as of now, my period came a few days earlier than I expected, lasted around 5 days, that 5th day being just the light pink/brown discharge, then it was gone )and the YI came lol).

As for sex, I don‚Äôt like period sex and the YI threw me off a bit lol. But to be completely honest, my sex drive has kind of tanked a little again. I‚Äôm just not craving it as much as I had right when I got off which definitely sucks. But I chalk that up to being nervous and stressed for leaving for the military soon.

14j5nq5,Healthyhooha,1687749362.0,"Since I was little, probably starting in middle school I've had a problem with odor down there. I will admit when I was younger I didn't have the best hygiene, but even as an adult and practicing good hygiene I still have this issue. I've been told my so many people throughout my life how horrible I smell. The comments are typically made after I use the restroom and everyone describes it as a strong onion smell mixed with vagina. It is so strong it will stink up the whole bathroom. I've been publicly embarassed, verbally abused and have lost friends over it. People literally hate me because of it. I've been told to kill myself so many times because it is a better than having this reputation. The smell is really bad when I have hair so I've learned to shave regularly. Even still, the smell can happen. If I've been sweating, even with very mild exercise like a relaxing walk, the smell can come back. I have used washes, Lume deodorant, powders, probiotics, boric acid suppositories and they do help most of the time but there are still times when I can notice it. I do my best to control it. But I feel that I have so much trauma and emotional damage created by it. I've been treated so terribly for something that is not really my fault. I don't have STDs or other infections but people think im dirty or a slut because of the odor. Oddly enough, I haven't had many men tell me about the odor during sex. I've asked and most have told me I don't have a smell. The smell happens when I go to the bathroom so it's very confusing. I think I may have bromhidrosis and sweat a lot on my inner thighs and labia. I'm so embarassed by this and feel ashamed I don't even want to do certain activities and can't trust people because many of my ""friends"" have made me into a joke.

tk3spf,Healthyhooha,1647958001.0,"Hello all!

I've been having this issue for years at this point - I've had 20+ confirmed UTIs, 2 kidney infections that sent me to the ER, and am now maybe on my 5th round of BV.

I was referred to a urologist for the chronic, recurrent UTIs once a few years ago, but they refused to prescribe me antibiotics despite testing positive for a UTI and I had to seek care elsewhere because without them, I could FEEL the UTI turning into another kidney infection. After that, I didn't trust them to treat me and didn't go back, and then moved and wasn't having sex for a long time so it sort of fell off my radar. My primary and I have, we think, traced the UTIs back to condom usage, so easy solution there right? I have a hormonal IUD, just stop using condoms! The problem then arises that when I don't use condoms, I get BV instead, and I'm losing my mind.

Before anyone asks, I wipe front to back, my partners are clean and hygienic (as am I), this has happened with both circumcised and uncircumcised partners, I ALWAYS pee immediately after sex, this has happened with IUDs, the pill, no birth control, etc., no scented soaps around my genitals and never soap inside the vaginal canal, I do everything right and this issue still persists.

An additional complicating factor here is my laundry list of antibiotic allergies - amoxicillin, penicillin, sulfa, ALL cephalosporins. Not great, and I really cannot be taking the few antibiotics I'm able to use as often as I've needed to because of this issue, resistance is a big and growing concern here. So it feels at this point like my options are:

1. Use condoms, almost definitely contract a UTI (that could turn into a kidney infection AGAIN) and have to take antibiotics, which will likely lead to BV themselves (which would require even more antibiotics) anyway
2. Don't use condoms and eliminate the risk of a UTI but instead risk of an STD and/or BV, both of which would also require me to use antibiotics (and that's if I get lucky and it's only gonorrhea or chlamydia or one that's treatable with antibiotics, consequences w this option obviously could be much more severe)
3. Get thee to a nunnery

I am really at a loss here, this issue is embarrassing and painful and at this point, scary. I've taken macrobid and azithromycin more times than I can count, and if I get a more serious infection and those stop working, I'm potentially really, truly fucked. If anyone has faced this same dilemma, and found a way to solve it, I'd be so grateful for your help!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/tk3spf/using_condoms_gives_me_utis_not_using_them_gives/,"Using condoms gives me UTIs, not using them gives me BV, I'm gonna join a convent",Advice Needed ,205,67,1.0,modernvintage

xm3typ,Healthyhooha,1663954244.0,"long post! TL;DR at the end.

possible tmi for this first part: i was having sex with my boyfriend and when i went to suck him off after he was just inside me i noticed that his dick tasted super sour. i knew the vagina was acidic but this flavour was like, battery acid strong? stronger than vinegar i would say. this wasn‚Äôt a one time occurrence; it was every time we had sex. 

i got concerned. i googled it. after doing some extensive research in multiple forums with entirely different perspectives and advices, i decided to try the methods that made the most sense: quitting caffeine and cigarettes.

and what do you know? two weeks later, i am having sex with my bf and taste his dick afterwards, and it tastes mildly sweet and only a tiny, almost unnoticeable bit sour, which actually created a very pleasant combo. i am in awe! 

just wanted to share for those having similar concerns. and, please do not use scented soaps, vinegar, or baking soda baths on your vulva or vagina (yes i have seen the last two being recommended followed by descriptions of how painful it was)

note: caffeine dehydrates you, making all your bodily fluids more concentrated and less diluted by water. by quitting caffeine and drinking more water, i might‚Äôve just ‚Äúdiluted‚Äù the flavour. and smoking generally affects the taste of the vagina, this has been proven. :)

*EDIT:* Okay, WOW! I can‚Äôt believe my tear filled rant has gotten THIS many comments and suggestions and support. Thank you to every single one of you for every tip, I was feeling so defeated this morning and now I feel like I have a whole new list of things to try and look into! Also FUCK the fact that there are 40 comments on this and almost all of them have been a woman saying they went through the same thing/ something similar. Truly can‚Äôt believe a Reddit post has been more informative and helpful to me than every doctor I visited combined. 

The very fact that there is a ""rant"" flair in a sub about women's health is just \*chef's kiss\* for my story.

This is going to be long-winded so I apologize now, but if you feel like getting angry about the health system failing yet another woman read on. 

TLDR: I have been struggling with a consistant BV/yeast/UTI for the past year and a half and every doctor I have gone to has told me the they don't know what's wrong with me and sent me home and it's sucks a lot. 

I am a 24-year-old female who has been struggling with vaginal health my whole life but more drastically this past year. I have been getting yeast infections regularly since I was an infant. My mom had to take me to the doctor at less than a year old and I was never allowed to have any soaps or bubbles in my baths because I am just \~prone\~ to yeast infections. That has stayed true my whole life but it turns out it's not just yeast infections, it's everything about my microbiome. I have gotten some combination of UTIs, BV, and yeast infections at least twice a year my whole life. Because of this, I know ALL the ""rules."" Nothing but breathable underwear, only wash with water, pee after sex, take probiotics, don't wear pants/underwear to bed, blah blah blah. I have heard it all and my WHOLE life revolves around maintaining these things. I will inconvenience myself to no end to make sure that I do not go a whole day without taking a probiotic because it means at least a week of misery.

Last year, I had what felt like a weird combo of a yeast infection and a UTI. It burned, but like all the time and internally and externally. I did the usual Monistat treatment and it didn't help. So I did what you're supposed to do and went to the doctor. She tested me for pregnancy, STI's, BV, UTI, and yeast. All came up negative. She sent me away with a pamphlet that told me to wipe front to back and not to douche. Sick. 

Fast forward to 6 months, 4 gynos, and 1 urologist later: I'm still in miserable pain, I can not leave my house without a full box of AZO because that seems to be the only thing that helps, and I have to pee every 3 seconds. Every single doctor tested me for those same things listed above. Every single test came up negative. By the end of the 6 months, I had been on 10 (no I am not exaggerating) different antibiotics which absolutely RUINED my gut health and my microbiome even more. I was bleeding for months at a time and every single doctor simply shrugged their shoulders and wrote me a new prescription for an antibiotic that they weren't sure was going to work. In the meantime, I was also trying to self-treat at home. I did everything I could find in the depths of reddit. Garlic, Hydrogen peroxide, apple cider vinegar, D-mannos, boric acid, changing my birth control brand/type, you name it. Finally I went to the last gyno and broke down sobbing in her office because I couldn't have sex with my boyfriend of two years and felt like I was broken and not one of these doctors could tell me what was wrong or made any effort to try. She decided to put me on metrogel for two weeks which is a super long time for that drug but it seemed to work, although I am not sure if it was that or the things I was doing at home. I really don't know what it was that finally resolved it. 

Everything seemed to be clear for about the next 9 months and I was feeling better. About 2 months ago, though, it came back. I have moved since this first happened so I had to find a new gyno and surprise surprise I go in, they give me the same test for the same things, it comes up negative. They tell me to come back because they want to do another test. Turns out it's the same exact test that, strap in, also came up negative again. So now I have spent $600 in the past two weeks for doctors to look me in the face and tell me they have no idea what is wrong with me or how to help me. It's now 2 days from christmas and I am supposed to go on vacation next week and I am scared to go because I can't even run to the store without wanting to burst into tears with pain. 

I have SCOURED every corner of the internet on this subject and I know that I am not the only one with a similar story. All of this is so say that I honestly can not believe that so many women suffer from similar situations like this and it is completely acceptable for doctors to just shrug their shoulders, charge you, and send you home. If you've gone through this, please let me know because it feels better to not be alone. And if you know some sort of saccrificial ritual I can do to help, please share...

Turns out she had a type of yeast that is only 1% of the yeast of infections and so rare so labs don't test for them. So when they say no yeast infection, you still can have yeast infection. Also it turns out you can have yeast resistance analysis which is also useful, works just like antibiotics resistance.

Her infection was saccharomyces cerevisiae, common baker yeast, and was resistant to Fluconazole, thus not responding to previous antifungal medication.

nzbeo6,WomensHealth,1623634420.0,"19F. Yesterday I was having a conversation with my mom, and somehow it progressed to talking about sexual stuff. I was diagnosed with vaginismus (no physical abnormalities but tightening of the vaginal muscles and bad pain with penetration) about 5 months ago. I told my mom right after the diagnosis but she brushed it off as me just being nervous. Yesterday I opened up to her in frustration and emotion about how hard it was, and that it was more than just normal pain. She told me to just push through the pain and get stuff all the way in. 

Along with this, I told her some sexual stuff with her encouragement for me to keep talking. I told her how I was worried to get in a relationship because I can‚Äôt have sex, and she told me that that was a major problem because no guy would want to be in a serious relationship without sex. I also told her about how I thought oral sex was gross (didn‚Äôt go into details or said I did it, which I have) and also about how one time when I was with a guy, he wanted me to do anal sex with him (but me penetrate him with a strap on) and how I found that gross and didn‚Äôt want to do that and was worried that guys wouldn‚Äôt want to be with me if I didn‚Äôt.

I also told her how I was trying to use dilators for my vaginismus to practice but hadn‚Äôt made much progress, and that I met up with my ex boyfriend a couple of weeks ago secretly and insinuated we did sexually stuff, and that that also hurt very badly.

I never told her not to tell anyone, but I figured that she wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äî especially not to my dad (I have overheard her telling him and other people things that I‚Äôve told her not to talk about before, but I feel like this is worse).

It was about a half an hour conversation, of my mom telling my dad everything that I told her. She told him that I didn‚Äôt like giving blowjobs, and about the anal sex thing with that guy, about how she was going to have nightmares about all this stuff, etc. My dad was like ‚Äúreally? Oh my god...‚Äù and just very shocked and disgusted. I felt like they were not just judging the guys but also judging me, and feeling disgusted about it. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable with my dad knowing those things about me. And also, I felt like the whole time my mom was talking to me, she was just baiting me for information so that she could gossip about it later with my dad.

Today, I was avoiding everyone and felt very anxious, embarrassed, and upset. I was in my room most of the day and made as minimal talk as necessary with my parents. I overheard them talking to each other about if I was ok, but was bugged me was what my dad said: ‚Äúgod only knows what she‚Äôs doing in there.‚Äù

I feel really embarrassed, angry, and only tiny tiny portion of myself finds this all amusing, but that is being replaced my the prior emotions as time passes. I feel like I can never trust my mom again with personal stuff. Should I confront her about it? Was what she did very wrong or is it justified from a parental perspective?",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/nzbeo6/advicerant_i_overheard_my_mom_telling_my_dad/,Advice/rant: I overheard my mom telling my dad about my sex life and very personal things and now I feel mortified,,201,30,0.98,veggieburgerabc123
kfn1fq,Healthyhooha,1608304901.0,Well today is sh*tty. I‚Äôve been having symptoms of itchiness and and burning. I already have pelvic pain syndrome and everything looked normal. I got tested for all the STD‚Äôs to make sure plus it was time for me to do it again anyways. I learned that I have Herpes simplex virus 2. I never had an outbreak so that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt know I had it. I just got the call from my doctor and that everything else was negative. I‚Äôm so upset right now. Because obviously herpes has no cure. And I feel like my sex life is over. I have some questions and need some advice from anyone who has it? Does herpes weaken my immune system? Can the outbreaks only be on my labia (in that area I know u can have it on ur face lips). My doctor is going to prescribe me a daily medicine to help prevent and treat symptoms. Meaning now al my doctors gotta know I have herpes. Can I spread herpes if I for example had unprotected sex but didn‚Äôt have an outbreak? Does anyone have any tips for how to get rid of outbreaks when they do happen? Can I still receive oral? Even tho there‚Äôs no cure can I ever test and it not be detectable in the blood anymore? Can this affect my scent down there? How often do outbreaks usually occur with daily medication? I‚Äôm so upset right now. I feel ugly and have no reason to live again.

ssk9lb,WomensHealth,1644869993.0,"I hope the title isn't too crude but I think it needs to be said bluntly. Things like oral contraceptives and other BC are a miracle for women. Having the OPTION to take it to protect yourself from unwanted pregnancy is YOUR right ( not an obligation). We are lucky.
Our grandmothers often could not say no to their partners. 

A lot has changed but much hasn't. 
I see now that men have weaponized women's contraceptive and made women and girls feel that:

A. It's your responsibility to get on the BC regardless of if you want to.

B. That if you are on contraceptive he can cum in you as much as he wants with zero accountability

C. That it's evil for you to even suggest he get a vasectomy if he never wants kids or try some other method like rhythm method 

D. That once you are on BC you have to take it til menopause or until he's done dating you. Even if it makes you sick.

E. That men shouldn't have to take BC with the same side effects of a women's contraceptive


So let's address these.

A1. I can't believe I have to say this but you don't have to take the pill just because it's normalized and accessible. It's actually a bit disturbing how much the side effects are downplayed. 

A2. I have my own horror story where i bled for months on end and doctors didn't care and told me it's fine and NORMAL and very common on that pill. Lost a lot of money because I couldn't work during some of this time. 
They actually hid this side effect from me even though I specifically asked about the most common side effects when I was asking them questions. You do not have to take it just because it's there and ""safe""

B1. The man is responsible for his sperm. You are not his receptacle. I'm a bit sick of men refusing to accept it's their fault they came in a woman repeatedly because she forgot or lied about BC. Yes so wrong to lie about taking your pill but also wrong for them to act as if BC is foolproof. No contraceptive is a 100%. They have to do THEIR PART.

B2. Furthermore semen is not good for your vagina's pH. This is an incredibly important point. 
I have heard multiple stories from women who didn't understand why they had constant vaginal infections. Only after ending their relationship did they realize that it was all because of him. No doctor ever told me this I had to learn it from other women's forums. Semen is naturally more alkaline and vaginas are supposed to be acidic. If he is cumming in you on a regular basis he is putting you at a high risk of infections and probably doesn't care. You're really going to destroy your health just so he can have a slightly better orgasm?

C1. If it's fair for him to want you to do it it's fair for you to expect him to do it. The amount of men who don't want kids or more kids ever but refuse vasectomy without even a moment's thought is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. At the very least the idea should be on the table for discussion.. Just like birth control is suggested to me from a young age boys should be routinely educated about their options and why it's their responsibility.  Not just condoms. For some reason if you merely suggest the idea they act as if you are trying to force it on them. It's pure projection.

C2. Also to elaborate on the rythm method which is as effective as the pill if both partners are doing their part. Most versions of the Rhythm method only mention tracking your cycle then using condoms near ovulation but the other step is the man actually doing the withdrawal method even when you are not ovulating. Used in conjunction this is an effective, SAFE, and fair option. No woman ever had a stroke from tracking her cycle. If you want to take extra precautions you can get ovulation tests

D1. This is self explanatory. I think most women know this but I've still seen men try to bully their girlfriends and wives into staying on birth control that is making them feel awful just because it will be a slight inconvenience for him if she stops.
I heard a story the other day about a woman who wanted to switch birth control and her boyfriend immediately told her that she can't because then she will start getting her periods again. Thankfully she broke up with him. Who is raising these boys?

E1. So they tested birth control pills on men. Men refuse to take them because then they would have to suffer the way women are expected to suffer. Also men are not the ones who have to carry the pregnancy so I think they would not be very trustworthy with it. Women are put through this without even being given proper warning. They give you a little pamphlet that they know most people are not even going to bother reading. 
Also the pamphlet downplays everything and flat out doesn't mention lots of side effects. You're basically expected to read 16 pages of fine print and comprehend all that the minute you become sexually active which for many women is when they are children. 

I'm glad I was able to access birth control when I was young but it's very sketchy situation and I would be pretty upset if my child was being given drugs without my knowledge. I understand they do this because otherwise teen pregnancy would be out of control. Still messed up

Final message. I'm not trying to demonize birth control pills or anything like that. Like I said in the beginning they are awesome but they are risky. I also know a lot of women do not really suffer the side effects. My friend has endometriosis and the pill was the only thing that made her life bearable. So go ahead and test it out but don't let society make you think you have to.

exa7i7,Healthyhooha,1580581020.0,"I will try to make this as short as possible but unfortunately my story, like many others I see here, is long. i have been dealing with this for almost 5 years. 24 y/o female.

fall/winter 2015: developed what I thought was a uti after sex and was treated for a uti without being tested for it, based on my described symptoms. went back to the doctor saying that i still had a slight discomfort urinating, but the uti test was negative to i was sent on my way. was informed by a guy i had slept with he had chlamydia. went to ob/gyn and told her i was told this. she prescribed me the typical one dose of azithromycin. i did not feel relief from the discomfort while peeing. i went back to the ob/gyn convinced i was not cured of the chlamydia. lab results indicated i was negative for chlamydia. doctor told me i was having anxiety ""from the thought of having an std"" 

2016-2019: symptoms progressively got worse. experienced constant discomfort urinating that sometimes was outright pain, discharge that ranged from clear to bright yellow/green and always mucus-y and always a LOT of it, pelvic pain, lower back pain, itchiness that would be so severe it would wake me up in the middle of the night, throbbing pains inside the vagina randomly, an extremely sensitive clitoris, and a constant feeling of burning sensation inside and outside of the vagina. eventually i even felt symptoms in my anal region. I also would randomly get fevers and chills. I went to 7 different ob/gyns, a dermatologist, an allergist, a urologist, and a urogynocologist. all my tests for everything always came back negatives. despite having high white blood cell counts, doctors basically all told me i was making it up or just had really bad anxiety and was overthinking things. i insisted that my pain was severe and very real. doctors tried to treat me for bv, yeast infections, and even prescribed 2 weeks of doxycycline just for good measures. i felt minimal if no relief. the only thing that seemed to help was coating the area in olive oil. towards the later years i also felt tired all the time, as well as flat out depressed and anxious. I could not understand how no one could figure out what was wrong with me. i graduated college and felt i could not hold a job because of how much pain i was in. i could barely stand to have sex, and if i did would bleed after usually. my periods became irregular. I became obsessed with researching possibilities online. 

2020: Finally, I discovered the mycoplasma forum on reddit. I demanded my original ob/gyn do a PCR test for mycoplasma. he had never heard of it. i insisted. I went a couple days later to an infectious disease specialist to have her perform the same test, plus antibiotic resistance tests (i was scared of getting a false negative and figured two tests wouldnt hurt). **I have been confirmed positive just this week (Jan 2020) for BOTH mycoplasma genitalium and ureaplasma, as well pneumonia of the urinary tract.** I am waiting to hear back about the antibiotic resistance as it takes longer. being as i had previously been on 2 weeks of doxy without relief, I asked for 14 days of moxifloxacin. initially i had felt a little better and became hopeful, but today (day 9) i have felt my symptoms return strongly. i am so upset that no one suggested these tests and that i had to demand them. i'm so angry at the multitude of doctors that suggested i was ""crazy"" all these years. i was hoping someone would have some advice for me. i am terrified reading online about how these infections are very hard to cure. i cannot live with this pain my whole life- it is unbearable. i wouldnt wish this physical, mental, and emotional stress on my worst enemy. i completely have forgotten what it feels like to pee without pain. 

Crazy how doctors always tell you not to worry yourself and read stuff online- when that is the ONLY thing that that helped me get answers. i knew i wasn't losing my mind! to anyone who is out there suffering and not getting answers- ADVOCATE FOR YOURSELF. You know your body best and you know when something is not right!

1) what do i do if i finish 14 days of moxi and still feel symptoms? i didnt respond to 2 weeks of doxy, should i try 3 weeks? 

2) due to my lower back pain and pelvic pain, i am terrified i have permanent scarring on my kidneys and/or ovaries. what tests can i ask for to determine if this is the case? is infertility from this permanent?

3) i have never even heard of pneumonia in the urinary tract. do you think this is unrelated, and that the ureaplasma just has left me susceptible to other infections?

4) I have had this for quite a long time- how can i be sure it is gone? obviously i am not going to have sex until i produce a negative result to prevent reinfecting.

pq2yc0,Healthyhooha,1631894466.0,"After getting married in March of 2020, I began getting what I thought were constant postcoital UTIs . I was prescribed antibiotic after antibiotic for them. Things never seemed to improve however in March of 2021 , things hit In March of 2021, I got a burning pain that felt like a constant UTI that just simply wouldn‚Äôt stopped. For months, I went to gyn after gyn believing I had a UTI that wouldn‚Äôt go away - however each time my tests came back normal. The OBGYNs treated me then for BV, yeast - everything under the sun. When I didn‚Äôt respond to treat , they make a slurry of claims. They said that my pain was purely psychogenic and to top it all off, they blamed my husband for abuse (by far not the case - I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better partner to spend my life with. The only reason why I believe they got this idea was because I am visibly Muslim and wear hijab). 

Fast forward to July of 2021, I was able to see a vulvar specialist at Northwestern Hospital.

Thanks to her , I have gotten the treatment I so desperately needed months prior and am living almost 90% pain free .

pe1njx,Healthyhooha,1630264513.0,"If you keep testing positive for BV, yeast, or UTIs despite completing treatment and are clear for all other STIs (chlamydia, gonorrhea, trich), please ask to be tested for **ureaplasma/mycoplasma via PCR cervix swab** if you haven't already. This goes for any person who is sexually active. Including giving/receiving unprotected oral.¬†This test is not included on basic STD panels, which is why many people haven't even heard of it before. 

It's important to note that cultures and urinalyses won't typically grow this bacteria. If you received a negative result for ureaplasma/mycoplasma at some point via culture, but still experience weird/unique symptoms, it would be in your best interest to be swabbed for it using a **PCR test** instead. Urine PCR is even less sensitive/effective, so *swab is best.*

Your doctors may refuse to test you for this bacteria because they believe it is naturally-occuring- this is a *myth* and it is *wrong*. Ureaplasma/mycoplasma is in fact an STI and it can lead to pelvic floor dysfunction, infertility, and miscarriages. It is also TREATABLE with **PROPER** antibiotics. Azithromycin, the same medicine used to treat chlamydia, will not be effective on its own in this case. **Doxycycline** has proven to eradicate the infection; a 7-10 day course 2x daily is all that's needed. You MUST treat your sexual partner, as well. Your symptoms of recurring BV, yeast, and UTIs *will* dissipate/resolve after treatment if you find that you are positive.

Personally, I dealt with constant infections back to back for 3 years straight before someone ON THE INTERNET suggested that I be tested for this. My doctor even mentioned that my cervix looked perfectly healthy and nothing appeared wrong. My symptoms ranged from burning after urinating to excess watery vaginal discharge with an odor. Others who have encountered this infection have reported various other symptoms which don't immediately appear to be caused by infection. 

Do not let a doctor dismiss you on your symptoms. If something feels wrong, listen to your body. You know your body the best. Some people have no symptoms at all but would never know they had this infection if they didn't ask to be tested specifically.

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. Honestly, I‚Äôm more concerned about how to wash my asshole. I can use water again for my vagina, but then what do I use for my butt area.

To say it was a living nightmare would be an understatement. I was in so much pain and discomfort, none of the doctors would take me seriously and would just prescribe a bunch of medicine and send me off, I was suicidal, I felt like I could never have a normal sex life (couldn‚Äôt dream of having sex more than once in a week). I tried everything under the sun, but to no avail, I tried the candida diet, probiotics, only wearing cotton underwear, etc but nothing seemed to work, the infections would still return. I thought this hell would never end until I saw a gynecologist specialized in vaginal infections. He told me my issues were recurring because I had probably messed up my vaginal flora with all the antibiotics/antimycotics I was taking for the infections, so the key was giving my vagina a clean slate. He tested me and I was only positive for BV this time, so I did the usual 7 day metronidazole treatment but this time, and this is key, he instructed me to take boric acid suppositories for 27 days after the metronidazole to kill off resistant organisms, and to do a week of vaginal probiotic suppositories after that so the lactobacillus could reconolize. Also, he advised to take oral probiotics throughout the entire course of the treatment.

So, I went in for my 5th gynecologist visit. I‚Äôve seen so many different doctors for this (hard to get an appointment with my preferred doc) and this doctor completely minimized my pain and suffering. I‚Äôm so done dealing with this and feeling invalidated. It ruined my sex life, I was in pain, and emotionally I just felt so down on myself. 

So I finally decided to get surgery. I was fully put to sleep, and the surgeon cut me open and decided which surgery to perform on the spot. My options were marsupialization and gland excision (much more invasive, but guarantees it won‚Äôt come back). 

I woke up a few hours later and she told me she excised the gland. That was yesterday. Yesterday, I was in quite a bit of pain but manageable. They sent me home with 4 doses of 5mg oxycontin and ibuprofen. That helped a lot with the pain yesterday. This morning I woke up, the pain meds wore off, and honestly the pain is not bad. 

I lean forward to pee so it doesn‚Äôt get on the wound, then I pour water on it just in case (doc recommended a peri bottle but I don‚Äôt want to go out and get one). Walking is a bit uncomfortable, I definitely wouldn‚Äôt walk more than 100 yards or so. I‚Äôve been wearing pads the past 24 hours, blood is still coming out slowly. Vulva is a little swollen.

I've noticed that in the week right before my period, I get increasingly depressed and emotionally unstable, in a very negative way. I just had my first day of this month's period, and I was seriously contemplating s***ide just last night. I reviewed plans I've made from previous episodes on what to do and how I was going to handle the situation and what wouldve happened after I was gone.

It's happened so much to the point that I have the whole thing planned generally planned out. (I really am sorry for talking about this..) It's been like this for the past couple of years..

If it's not that, it's usually a series of bad panic attacks that often last for 6hrs. At times I don't sleep or eat. (Which was the case just hours ago too.. I had to be force fed to break my fast).

I can't afford counseling and therapy, but I only realize this pattern once my period hits. The worst feelings and behaviors manifest up until the moment I get my period.. then it gradually simmers down from there 

I'll be honest.. I am still feeling the same feelings I had just hours ago. But I do want to figure this out, even if it may just be the scientific/technical aspect of it. Am I the only one crying and rocking myself, drowning in my thoughts until my period arrives? Does anyone else experience this?

If I am in the wrong sub, please redirect me!

To be completely honest I don‚Äôt actually know how to clean my vagina, nobody ever taught me, I only found out this year, that your not supposed to use soap down there. If anyone could even give me a step by step on how to wash down their.

im1cl1,Healthyhooha,1599164451.0,"Inspired by a recent TikTok I watched where commenters insisted that thongs were more comfortable. I wore thongs in HS and college before deciding they were way more trouble than they were worth. I just find that fabric in my buttcrack and directly pressing on my butthole all day to be really irritating! I'd wear one for a special occasion but I just can't see how it's comfortable. Do I have an oversensitive butt? I can feel it sliding up and down all day, ""butt floss"" is an accurate term, and that shit is just so uncomfortable! How is that better than regular underwear?

Some people said regular underwear gives them wedgies and yes, a thong is prob more comfortable than that. But I feel like that could be avoided by just buying the right size underwear, I only get wedgies from old worn out pairs and when that happens, it's a sign I need to throw them out.


If you find thongs more comfortable, explain yourself. I just do not get it and yes, I have worn them, various styles, various sizes. Is the comfort of freed buttcheeks worth the fabric jammed in the crack all day? Does it depend on your butt size/shape? Some people said they didn't even feel it...am I the only one who has nerve endings back there?

Thongs are uncomfortable, change my view.

A whole bunch of edits below:

OK I HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION NOW - for those of you that wear thongs, back when it was a thing, did you also wear/look good in low-rise jeans? I always got plumber's crack no matter what. So I am wondering if it's just my weird buttcrack lol

also how do i get the thong to rest gently on top of my buttcrack instead of all up in my cheeks?

also its funny how half of you find thongs more comfortable because you have a big butt, and the other half of you finds thongs uncomfortable because you have a big butt.


I can def see how regular underwear is uncomfortable for some people but i would probably just not wear underwear in that case

MORE EDITS:

wow, this has been really interesting! I'm starting to realize that I'm probably kind of fussy about comfort. I hate shapewear, strapless bras, heels, tight clothes...I usually don't even need a thong since I don't wear tight enough clothes for VPL.
But as there are women on this planet who insist that heels are comfortable, so there are women who insist that thongs are.

One more edit: 

U/thayaht solved the case in this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/im1cl1/do_you_find_thongs_comfortable/g3xsc26/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

Never would have thought there‚Äôd be such varied anatomy!

Now y‚Äôall have me looking at butts in nsfw subs looking for all the variations that could affect this lol. And there‚Äôs so many! Tight butts, loose butts, deep buttcracks, shallow buttcracks, buttcrack length...all of these could affect comfort way more than if you just have a big/small butt.

And everyone, please do not take this personally, it‚Äôs a shitpost about underwear. I assumed people who say things are comfortable are like people who say heels are comfortable. See what I mean? Didn‚Äôt realize there‚Äôs like a thousand kinds of buttcheeks.

After swimming for a while I couldn't get it out. I tried for 2 hours, I was in tears it hurt so bad. I had to go to the doctor to get it out. She said I just had a thick hymen.

At 21 on my first visit to the GYN they found a mass in my breast. After imaging and biopsies it turns out to be a fibroadenoma. In three years I've had 3 breast masses, three biopsies, one lumpectomy and imaging every 6 months. Now, at 24, my GYN took a closer look at my hymen when I started crying from pain during my pap. As it turns out I have a sepatated hymen (i'm a virgin) and that's why I can't wear tampons. She says I should have a hymenectomy to avoid lots of pain and bleeding during sex.

wafdfa,Healthyhooha,1659028138.0,"Recently I got a new job that involves transporting/storing high value objects and artifacts. Some days, this is local work at museums and collectors homes. Other times, its long trips. Monday was my first long trip- it was also the first day of my period. So at this new job, on my first trip, I was fighting bad cramps, driving a big truck, other new aspects of the job, and limited access to bathrooms. I was also meeting my co driver for the first time. We drove 22 hours straight through to deliver the object, it was rough. Yet somehow, I managed not to bleed onto my new work pants or the truck seat.

Luckily, we spent the next night in hotels and I had a chance to rest. The next day, I was having issues getting my menstrual cup to seal properly. Stressful when you have a long drive ahead- any my co-driver somehow only needs to pee when we fill up the 100 gallon tank.

So mid way into the trip, we switch drivers but the station I pulled into didnt have a working restroom. Whoops. I let him know I will need one soon. At this point im very anxious that my cup is leaking or starting to. I spend the next three hours nervously shifting around trying to clench all my muscles in some misplaced hope that I can control the flow. This dude passes by dozens of suitable rest stops and truck stops.  I was pissed and it felt dehumanizing. 

When someone says they need. restroom- why the fuck would you wait three hours? I was considering blurting out details about my flow to get him to understand. On the other hand, I shouldn't need to disclose my menstruation status for my needs to be taken seriously?

This is the only mention of the domestic violence in the whole article: "" According to the police report, Parscale's wife had bruises on both her arms. She said she sustained the injuries 'a few days ago, during a physical altercation with Bradley, which she did not report,' the document said.""

Every single top comment on NPR's article on Facebook is something along the lines of ""Regardless of political party, we all deserve to get mental health help. Hoping he recovers!"" No one is mentioning that he's been found to abuse his wife, Candice Parscale. She literally reported to the police that she was so afraid of him that she ran out of the house, and had to go next door to call 911.

But no, Brad is the real victim here! Someone who has been campaigning for Trump, who is trying to gut the very healthcare system Brad himself needs. I have no pity for this man, and I'm so sick of the media basically just accepting that hurting your wife is expected during a mental health crisis, to the point where they don't feel that part of the story is headline worthy or even more-than-two-sentences worthy.

I was diagnosed with cervical cancer last year, April 2020. Luckily, it was stage 1a1 and I think I'll be okay.. I started getting pap smears every year since I was 21 and it was normal every single year. When I was 25 it came back normal, but positive for HPV type 16. My doctor told me that I'm young and my immune system will fight it off. Come one year later, I had my first abnormal pap, then a colposcopy, then LEEP to remove high grade abnormal cells. The LEEP results came back as cancer. 

A couple weeks later, I went to an oncologist who diagnosed me with stage 1a1, which felt like a miracle. I had convinced myself that if this cancer showed up so quickly it must be super aggressive and I was probably already about to die. Dr. Google told me that only women age 60+ who have already had abnormal paps for several years get cervical cancer. Apparently not. The only treatment I needed was a cervical cone biopsy.

Anyway, my point is please get a pap smear EVERY SINGLE YEAR. Who knows where I'd be if I waited the reccomeded three years. I kept hearing from my doctors how ""unlucky"" I was, but I'm glad I figured that out early. Now I'm just left the mental battle over wether it'll ever come back or not.

r9jyrz,Healthyhooha,1638723641.0,"Wanted to share here cuz it's so wild to me and only person I could tell is my boyfriend. Maybe it will help someone as well. It's a mini novel, so buckle up.

So a few months after getting IUD inserted years back, I couldn't feel my strings. Got seen and was told strings wrapped around my cervix. Totally fine and normal I guess.

Then, 3 yrs ago I had a weekend of camping/romping at a festival with my boyfriend. When I got home, I was showering and noticed I had something in me I could feel that was pea sized and the more I tried to feel it the more I couldn't quite reach it... FREAKED out thought it was a tick or something else foreign. Mind racing at possibilites.
Went to ER at 2am. Male ER dr looked and shrugged saying ""probably a stuck tampon. I'd go to your regular dr in a few days."" Ummm no it's fucking not. He was a cocky guy that reminded me more of a soap opera dr. Dismissive attitude and slick-gelled hair. 800 dollar bill.

At the time, I didn't have a ""set"" gyno or primary care provider, but I was able to schedule a visit with the same female dr who inserted my IUD  a year prior.

She took one look, said all was normal, just that my IUD strings had knotted which was rare but shouldn't be cause for a problem. 

Then started months on and off of an infection, I would take a lot of probiotics or boric acid suppositories, one round of antibiotics; it would clear things up but when I got my period/finished period, infection/weird smells would come back. Periods smelled something AWFUL like rotting :( 

Finally got my new insurance and my first ever general well woman gyno visit scheduled (before I was on my parent's insurance, only got pap smears, IUD insertion, STD testing thru primary.)

The second I'm down on the gyno table, legs spread, she takes one look and says ""OMG something is IN HERE."" 3 people were in the room- nurse, a PA student shadowing, and the doc. Very nerve wracking with all these eyes on me. I was scared, but then remembered 3 yrs ago I was told about the knot. Told her and she said something was attached to the strings and strings are blue, this was a blackish/grey ish color. She said, ""This is absolutely unacceptable and we are getting it out right now."" 
Apparently it was hard for her to cut it out without pulling out my IUD but she was able to do it.

Sorry it's kinda gross but it looked a bit smaller than a peanut, weird greyish color. She thinks it was hair bundled around it or maybe a piece of fuzz or something else got shoved up there when I had put in a tampon and hardened. She said she would not have any doubt in her mind it was throwing off my PH and body kept fighting it.

I had scoured this sub for periods that smelled like death, recurring infections and only saw 1 to 2 posts about something similar and someone said when strings are knotted the gyno should cut it out. So I was relieved to find that post and decided it was time for my first ever true gyno wellness woman exam. I have anxiety and just starting to figure out all this stuff out on my own as age 26 is when you're kicked off parent's insurance in my state.

Long story short...Gyno thinks that it was throwing off my PH. Ran a wet swab and everything else is normal but I did have a PH of 4.5 so borderline with being susceptible to infection. She truly thinks I should be back to healthy again fixing root cause of issues..I feel relieved but also angry that 2 other drs prior to her never thought this should come out of me! 

Tl/dr: strings knotted on IUD. Something attached to it. Body fought it as foreign object, led to recurring infection. Just wanted to share my experience, not to freak someone else out! Overall happy with IUD but if you suspect your strings are knotted, advocate for getting knot snipped off!

z1frwj,WomensHealth,1669078318.0,"I mostly just need to get this off of my chest because I'm miserable.   


I'm honestly over the healthcare journey that I've been on and am genuinely considering just shrugging and letting the precancerous cells turn into cancer. The disrespect for my bodily autonomy and medical gaslighting the whole way has been so uncalled for and maybe if I just straight up have cancer, I'll be listened to. /enddramaticrant  


So, I (28F) had an abnormal pap back in.. July? because I presented for a complaint of sharp pelvic pain in my cervix during sex that lasted several days and wanted my IUD placement checked. The answer was ""oh, yeah, the strings are here, it's there"" and left at that, which I felt frustrated by. I agreed to do a pap two years early because fuck it, new insurance, I'm there, whatever.   


Comes back abnormal. I've had abnormal smears before as a teen, normally it's just been recheck it in 6 months to see if it comes back normal. They push for a colposcopy... and push, and push, so I finally agree, against my wishes because paps are uncomfortable at best and a colpo is painful. I intentionally switched locations (in corporatized healthcare system) because the location I switched to claimed they could do a local anesthetic for it. They lied. I get there in September, get checked in, get to the room, and ask about the local, and they tell me they don't have the type of needle they need to do a local, but it's not painful and it'll take like 2 seconds, so I finally cave on having two women looming over me and demanding that I do it. Behold, it is painful, I scream bloody fucking murder and almost kick the GYN to get her away from me, and they look shocked that I was telling the truth?   (ETA: *and* I just got a $400 bill in the mail for the colpo I didn‚Äôt want today, so that‚Äôs a fun phone call to the insurance company to see why they didn‚Äôt cover it when it was insisted upon as a necessary procedure). 


They make me sign surgical paperwork then and there for the LEEP without getting the results back and tell me they do it under anesthesia (cool!). They tell me they have to remove my IUD for it. I ask if instead of replacing the IUD, we can just do a hysterectomy because I have no intentions of having children (my partner was in the room and agreed that we have no intentions of having children). They say no, insurance won't cover it and it'll be $60k. Okay, I ask if we can do a tubal, they say no again because I'm 28 and childfree.   

I got together the paperwork for the IUD because the GYN was like ""oh well we'll just do one more IUD and then you'll be old enough for us to /think/ about doing sterilization"" just in case but it was bothering me immensely. The concept of pregnancy gives me gender dysphoria like a MF, like, I'll unalive myself if I get pregnant without even considering an abortion first because it's such an extreme squick for me. I called my insurance and double checked that all sterilization is covered - it is - and then I called the office about two weeks ago because I hadn't heard back for surgical scheduling yet and asked if it was an office-wide thing that they don't do tubals or if it's just the one doctor. I got the voicemail back today that it's the whole office because I'm ""28 and don't have any children"" and they ""don't feel comfortable doing it"" while I'm already under anesthesia.   


I'm calling a different GYN office in the morning where the doctor has added herself to the list of providers that provide salpingectomies, but just like... wtf, man, I just want to be listened to for once in my life without being talked down to or treated like I'm lesser by the healthcare system, especially when it's other women perpetuating it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/z1frwj/why_is_womens_healthcare_so_misogynistic/,Why is women's healthcare so misogynistic?,Rant,183,42,0.96,brinakit
lqo8yb,Healthyhooha,1614102226.0,"

When I google how to relieve yeast infections I haven't found very good advice. I've found medication to cure it, but not how to deal with the symptoms at the moment. I've been getting these lately and I've been finding what best works for me to help relieve the symptoms, so now I'm going to post this here in case it helps anyone else.

Side note: listen to your body. If you feel like this is hurting it then stop. This process should be soothing. If it's not, then be more gentle or maybe try something else. If you're itching it along the way, that's fine, but itching it is different than hurting it

Every time I pee or every time I feel too itchy I go through this process to keep the symptoms under control. If I don't do this, then my vaulva gets all itchy and irritated and I feel miserable. 

As soon as I suspect a yeast infection what I do is:

TD; DR (longer version at bottom) 

1) get a cup of water

2) wash hands

3) wash the area with your hands and the water

4) clear all white stuff around the area

5) wash and dry hands again

6) dry the area using just your hands and not toilet paper. TP irritates the area and makes it itchy. Make sure to dry between all the folds and crevasses using your fingers. 

7)most important: always make sure the area is dry after peeing, putting cream on it, or after noticing any discharge around the area.

8) if you decide to use cream, Monistat is a great over-the-counter medicine to use (edit: Vasoline or olive oil is said by commenters to work well too).

9) With any cream make sure to rub it in completely. Cream is wet and wet will make you itchy.  Don't let a bunch just sit there in a puddle on your vulva. The feeling should be similar to what chapstick feels like after putting it on your mouth lips.

10)wear cotton underwear (edit: or nothing)

11)eating yogurt that promotes healthy bacteria is good. Choboni yogurt is great. (Edit: staying away from too much sugar is said by commenters to help the symptoms)

12) if you've been doing great for a while and you're not itchy and then suddenly you start becoming itchy again, then discharge may be coming out of your vagina. So go clean and dry it again.




Longer version:

 After I pee I wash the area outside the vagina with water, only use water. Wash your hands before you start this process. Get a cup of water, so it's right there and ready for you to use, mild cold water works great. I like to put some water in my hand and gently rub while removing discharge 

While washing, clear all the discharge/yeast from the area with your hands. Don't use toilet paper. It irritates the skin. After clearing the discharge your vulva should look all pink with no white stuff anywhere around it. After doing that, clear anything around the asshole too. If you touch the vaginal discharge, wash your hands before you go to the anus and vise versa. Don't spread the infection to other parts.

Side note #2: You should be washing your hands multiple times during this process so you're not spreading anything. 
 
After you clear the discharge, wash and dry your hands again. After that, go back to your vulva and now you're going to dry it

Drying is important. When the area is wet it gets itchier, when it's dry it's less itchy. So make sure you dry it, but you have to do it a certain way or else it will get itchy and irritated again

To do this, you need to dry all the little folds and crevasses of your vulva, use your freshly washed and dried hands to do this. Don't use toilet paper... However, you can use toilet paper to help dry off the surrounding area, but not all the little folds and crevasses. Toilet paper will irritate things, so be careful with that 

After you're done drying then you are good. You may still feel itchy, but it should hopefully feel better than before 

Other useful things:

If you wear underwear wear cotton underwear. This is super important. Don't wear underwear that feels like cotton, but isn't. Some materials trap moisture and makes the yeast infections worse. Pure cotton consistently dries the area as it gets wet and somehow doesn't trap the moisture there. Wear that or wear nothing 

If you have a cream meant for yeast infections (edit: or vasoline) use that. If you don't have it, that's ok, I would suggest buying something though. Being dry is good, but having some sort of cream to let the skin slip around without getting stuck to each other is really good (edit: someone mentioned olive oil working for this. I haven't tried it, but it's worth noting). I like using the Monistat cream, but use whatever works

If you put cream around the area to help with itchiness don't let it bunch up and just sit there. Its wet and wetness makes the skin itchy. Put it on after you clean the vulva, then rub it in well, then basically dry it again, while keeping the area a tad slippery (similar feeling to how chapstick feels after putting it on mouth lips).

Change underwear frequently or don't wear it at all

Eat yogurt that promotes good bacteria. Choboni yogurt works well

FYI: idk if doing all this will help cure the infection. I'm assuming it won't help cure it. This guide is meant to help make the symptoms bearable, but don't wait and see if they'll clear up with this. Go get some over-the-counter YI medicine or antibiotics or something.

If anyone else tries this and/or has any feedback of their own on how to handle yeast infections, feel free to share. I'd like to read about it 

Edit: I gave up sugar for unrelated reasons and found that my yeast infections completely went away, so really watch your sugar intake or maybe try taking a break from it all together

Ha. Young, lacking confidence, and craving affection while living over 1400 miles from my family and friends. I was on the pill, took it regularly (though few people are perfect as far as exact timing) and used condoms; doubling methods should be extra safe, right? 

------

Let‚Äôs talk about the efficacy of different birth control methods (CDC, 2022):

MALE CONTRACEPTIVES

Male Condom: Worn by a man, this common method has a typical-use failure rate of 13%.

FEMALE CONTRACEPTIVES

Female Condom: Worn inside a woman, the failure rate is 21%.

Oral contraceptives (The Pill): The combined-hormone version has a typical-use failure rate of 7%. The progestin-only version, which I am on currently since the combined version causes me to vomit, also has a 7% rate of failure.

Hormone Patch: Worn for three weeks, followed by one week without. Failure rate is 7%.

Contraceptive ring (hormonal): Worn for three weeks, removed for a week, then replaced. Again, the failure rate is 7%. 

Spermicides: Foam, gel, cream, film, suppository, or tablet that is supposed to kill sperm inside the vagina. Failure rate is 21%. Note that spermicides may be present on male condoms. 

Arm Implant (Nexplanon, Implanon): A thin rod is inserted into a woman‚Äôs arm, releasing hormones for up to 3 years. Failure rate is 0.1%. (I used this for several years and suffered excess weight gain, severe migraines, and depression).

Injection (The Shot): A progestin shot given every three months. Failure rate is 4%.

Fertility Tracking: Monitoring your menstrual cycle to help track fertile windows. Failure rates range from 2-23%. 

Intrauterine Device (IUD): There are hormonal versions which can be used for 3 to 6 years and have a failure rate of 0.1 to 0.4%. There is also the hormone-free copper version, which lasts for up to 10 years and has a failure rate of 0.8%. (I had the copper IUD for 3 years before I started bleeding randomly; after 87 days of non-stop bleeding and a fight to get an ultrasound, it was found the IUD was turned sideways and implanted in the wall of my uterus. I loved this contraceptive method, but there are risks involved, some which can be very serious).

I‚Äôd also like to draw attention to a glaring discrepancy in the number of available contraceptive methods for men versus women.

Note that I didn‚Äôt even include other female methods like diaphragms, sponges, the lactational amenorrhea method, or permanent sterilization.

No, I was not married to this man, but then I am a godless harlot who believes in the mental and physical benefits of a healthy sex life. America as we know it was founded by immigrants seeking freedom from religious prosecution (and achieved that ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù through genocide of the existing residents of North America). Today, we have moved backwards in more ways than one; I feel as though some of us are now seeking freedom from prosecution for lacking a religion. 

In a recent study along the U.S.-Mexico border, it was found that majority of abortion-seekers were between 20-29 years old (59.7% of sample population), over 65% were in their first trimester (within 12 weeks of conception), and most had to travel hundreds of miles to reach a clinic offering abortion services (Leyser-Whalen et al, 2021).

Comparing my personal experience, I was just about to turn 21, am estimated to have reached 12-13 weeks along, and had to travel 165 miles to the nearest clinic. Keep in mind that I had scheduled the appointment at 7 weeks; the first available appointment was more than a month after my call for help. 

Want to hear about the procedure? No? Well, that is unfortunate, because this is too important not to be shared. 

I arrived at the clinic, which was surprisingly quiet so early that Montana morning. No protestors. I filled out some paperwork, was asked several times if I was sure about my choice and then was escorted to the waiting room. There were two other women in the room, both who had their partners with them; I sat alone. One woman was in the corner --- I never heard her speak a word to her companion or anyone else. The woman to my left was very chatty. Holding her husband‚Äôs hand, she told me how she had been diagnosed with post-partum depression after the birth of her first child, how she could not go through that again. She says they were careful.

After what felt like an eternity (but was only a little over an hour), I was escorted to a sort of holding room. There, the nurse explained what would happen during the procedure. I was given an ultrasound to confirm the pregnancy and establish gestational age. The ultrasound was shown to me. They gave me some pill that is supposed to soften the cervix, making manual dilation easier. After the medication had time to work, I was taken to see the doctor. My legs in stirrups, with the doctor and one nurse between my legs, and another woman, perhaps a CNA or another nurse, holding my hand, a thin tool was used to dilate my cervix. It took a few subsequently larger sizes before they could proceed. 

My most vivid memory during this process is the extreme pain --- I was awake during it all. There had been some sort of numbing swab applied, but like when the dentist goes starts drilling your teeth, it wasn‚Äôt enough. I squeezed that poor woman‚Äôs hand as hard as I possibly could, feeling dizzy, with the distinct sensation that someone had dumped ice-water over my head which then ran down my body. This, of course, makes no sense since that would require water to fall horizontally. I could feel the sensation of suction inside my body. I felt so dizzy. After the procedure was completed, I sat up with the help of the older nurse who had been at the doctor‚Äôs side. She helped clean up the blood from between my legs and assisted me in applying the thickest sanitary napkin I have ever seen in my life. 

After taking several minutes to make sure I would not pass out, I was helped to an adjacent recovery room. I stayed there for over an hour and was given 800 mg of ibuprofen, some juice, and a small pack of mini cookies. There was another woman there, also post-procedure, who I had not seen before. Soon after my arrival, the chatty woman from the first waiting room arrived; she was much less talkative. While recovering, the nurse spent time with me discussing a wide variety of contraceptive methods. I got a whole packet of information, and together, we decided that it was worth trying the arm implant Nexplanon, since this whole ordeal started while I was on the pill, and the arm implant had a lower failure rate. Then it was over. 

Or so I thought. For the next six-ish months, I was in a fog. I was paranoid every time my period was due, accompanied by the awful PMS I am so used to. For someone who has an irregular cycle, the delay in the arrival of the bleeding is anxiety-inducing. I‚Äôm nauseous --- I must be pregnant (though that would require some divine conception for my presently abstinent self). I‚Äôm cramping; pregnant. I have a headache; pregnant. That smells weird; pregnant. Though every ounce of logic said these worries were physically impossible, my mind would not stop telling me that I would have to go through this process all over again. I cried so, so much. I was scared to let anyone touch me. I am crying now as I spill my story. My choice. 

Was this a difficult decision? The most. Do I still think about what may have been? Yes, though it is less often now, ten years later. Do I regret my choice? Never. 

Had I carried this person‚Äôs baby to term, there would be a permanent tie to a person who verbally threatened to kill me (and don‚Äôt forget the hidden ammo story). If I had ended up with a child from this relationship that I never should have been in, I would be dead. No, not from a botched procedure, maybe not from this person‚Äôs violence, but from myself. I was in such a dark place, emotionally drained, scared, confused. I would have killed myself. I tried it. Thankfully, I didn‚Äôt do a great job. 

Ten years have passed. I am engaged to a wonderful man, the kindest, most supportive, most logical person I have ever known. He respects me. He understands the choices that I have made. We love each other, and we hope to try for a family soon. I have been seeing a therapist, my depression is part of me, but I have learned healthy ways to process the challenges that we encounter.
 
Friends will likely be lost after sharing this story. I know that some of my family is very strongly against abortion, and I understand that they may no longer wish to speak with me. People may never see me in the same way they did before, for better or worse. 

I cannot say that I don‚Äôt care what they think, because I truly do. If I didn‚Äôt care, this story would have been shouted from the rooftops in November 2013. I am scared. But I believe that my experience is important. The attack on healthcare is too important to ignore. I can‚Äôt take it for granted that things will all work out that way I would hope for, so here is my story. My choice.

1599bvi,Healthyhooha,1690293548.0,"This post is targetted towards young people who are going to have sex and are curious about it.

As a young woman, I was scared of sex due to lack of valid and useful available information on it. I did not have penetrative sex for a long time out of this fear mostly (apart from the fact that I was not prepared for it).

The idea that something enters a delicate part of my body was scary. I asked my peers who have had sex if sex is supposed to hurt. 
My friend, a woman who had had sex by then, chuckled and said, ""the pain is the fun part"", in all sincerity.

But when I had sex, I realised that it is not supposed to hurt.  AT ALL!
There will be some discomfort when something first penetrates you since your body is new to this sensation, but if you're mentally and physically ready, and have had a nice build up till penetration, it should not hurt at all.

There can be some pain the first time, which is completely normal. But my suggestion would be to not continue having sex through the pain, especially if you're deriving no pleasure from it. You should stop and resume when you feel ready. I don't have a lot of knowledge on this for the first time scenarios. But I can say that even now, whenever I experience pain during penetrative sex, I immediately stop. And I can resume again when the pain is gone and I feel ready for some action again.

You should also keep some fragrance-free lube handy (never skimp on lube, always invest in quality). And don't ever skip using a condom. Get a basic plain condom of good quality. Don't go for textured condoms when you're just starting out.
If your partner refuses to use condoms citing stupid reasons, don't let them anywhere near your body. If your sexual health is compromised, you're the one suffering. 

For anyone like me, who is worried about the same, please bear in mind that your safety is the most important part. Don't have sex with someone who doesn't feel safe, especially for your first time.

I am not a medical practitioner, but as a fellow vagina-haver, this is what have realised and experienced. And I wanted to make this available for someone like me who is worried about this.

If you're having penetrative sex for the first time, make sure you are ready and more importantly willing for it. If you experience pain, immediately stop whatever you are doing. If the pain persists, please go to a doctor and get it checked out.

You might stay sore for a day or two after you have sex. But make sure to see a doctor if it's pain.

I don't have much knowledge about vaginal conditions that might cause such issues, but it is common knowledge that penetration -- without any underlying medical conditions -- should NOT hurt you.

Edit 1: advice on using lube and condoms.

Edit 2: elaborated on the bit about having medical conditions that might cause pain or persistent discomfort. PLEASE GO TO A DOCTOR. DON'T STAY IN PAIN. You should at least know what is causing pain.

1ctpflj,WomensHealth,1715897532.0,"Hi Ladies, I need advice. I'm planning on leaving a review and reporting him to the Texas Medical Board but I feel like I'm going crazy and don't feel justified in reporting. I'd like to hear what y'all think (TLDR at bottom) 

2 days ago I noticed what looked like a boil or cyst on my right labia. Yesterday this boil started to grow and become very irritated making it hard to sit down and hurt to walk around. I checked google and started putting a warm compress on it throughout the day to get it to drain naturally but knew I would probably need to get antibiotics to keep from infection. The boil (now know it was a cyst) was about 1cm big, pea-edamame sized and looked like it was possibly infected, hence the urgent care trip, and very red and inflamed. Wanted to be safe rather than sorry and decided it was better to go get antibiotics and start them that night just in case it started draining. It was pretty late at night and there was only 1 urgent care open, which was not the urgent care I typically went to. 

Get to the urgent care, fill out the papers. Receptionist sees my paperwork and lets me know they only have a male doctor, and if that would be ok. Male doctors doing my exams in sensitive areas wasn't my favorite thing. Had some good experiences, had some bad. I said it was fine, since I assumed he was just going to examine if it looked infected and maybe prescribe some antibiotics. Wait for a bit in the waiting room then the nurse pulls me back for vitals. She was extremely sweet, talked about her bartholin's cyst and how it sounded like that could possibly be my problem. She told me to get undressed from the waist down, gave me a cover up, and she let me know she would be in the room with me while the doctor took a look.

Doctor comes into the room. It was an older man in his 70's or 80's. He did not introduce himself, he did not ask me what I was in for. I said hello, tried to start talking about my problem and he interrupts me with just a ""show me it."". Rude and weird as we haven't even had a conversation yet but whatever, it's late at night. 

I get on my back, there were no sternups or anything so I kind of awkwardly had my legs frog style. He immediately began touching the area- which was very red and tender and painful without a single word. Not a huge fan of that. My gyno's and dr's have always told me what they were about to do, especially when touching in or around my vagina. I asked him to tell me if it looked infected, if I could just let it drain and if I would need antibiotics (been super anxious about sepsis recently which was the biggest factor for coming in). He mentions that it looked like it may have started draining and then asked the nurse to grab him a paper towel. 

Suddenly I felt a huge stinging pain on the area where the cyst was. Enough to make me yelp in pain and scoot back from him. He was popping my cyst. Popping it! No lancing, no gentle squeezing, no pain relief, NOTHING! He hadn't even wiped the area before popping a cyst, possibly making it more infected if it wasn't already. After the first wave of pain, nearly passing out he kept squeezing very hard I said ""that hurts really bad can you stop?"" and he did not stop. He squeezed again, and I yelped again and said ""I'm serious I haven't had any ibuprofen or anything this hurts so bad please stop"". Still no words spoken to me at this point. I was pissed, and in a lot of pain. I had wanted it to drain naturally because I didn't want to risk any extra scarring even with a cut or lance, but I will get even worse scarring from this doctor popping it! He took the paper towel and kept wiping and I winced in pain and told him to seriously stop touching it. He finally backed off, and waddled over to his clipboard all without saying a single word to me. The female nurse was in the room, silent this entire time- mind you.

He finally spoke up to ask me how much I weighed and if I was allergic to any medications because now that it's ruptured I needed to be on antibiotics immediately so I don't get infected. I couldn't believe what had just happened. He had not asked me if I wanted it ""drained"" if you could even call it that. He had not talked to me about what he was going to do. And if he had listened to me as he waddled over, he would have heard me say that I've been doing warm compresses to get it to drain naturally. I had to ask the female nurse for a panty liner so that I wasn't (TMI) leaking puss and blood all over my panties while I waited 45 minutes at a CVS to start my antibiotics. He left the room, without sharing any aftercare, without asking me if I had any questions. Nothing, just left. I just have this big gaping wound on my labia that I guess I'm just trying to keep clean and not pee on?

I have gotten cysts drained before at doctors offices, by the way. Cysts on my vaginal opening and urethral opening have been drained at gyno appointments. They are supposed to give you some kind of local numbing and it is done on request with either a lance or a cut. They certainly didn't squeeze-pop them without consent and they were explaining everything they were doing, before doing it. And the most important thing was when the pain was bad and I said ""break"" or ""stop"" and they would stop. 

I left the clinic feeling violated. I'm upset that this cyst is going to scar more because he ruptured it without a care in the world. I had not asked him to drain my cyst on any kind of paperwork. I am upset he had not asked for any kind of consent before doing it. I was not there on request of a cyst draining. I had requested an exam to check for infection and to possibly get antibiotics. 

I will be following up with my primary care physician, just to check for damage and proper aftercare instructions. I am planning on leaving a review on the clinics google page, which I found also had a few 1 star reviews about ""the older gentleman"" that took care of them. I want to also report to the medical board, but I have no strong evidence against him. I am a SA victim, and I'm already very uncomfortable with people touching me in that area. And I feel like he scarred me without my consent. 

Any and all advice or support is greatly needed right now <3

TLDR: Went to doctor for centimeter sized cyst on labia to examine if it was infected and to get antibiotics. Male doctor refused to speak to me, and squeeze-popped my cyst without talking to me, without consent, without pain relief and refused to stop squeezing after I had asked him to stop, twice. My risk of infection is higher, and the area is going to scar. Left me no aftercare instructions. Gave me antibiotic prescription. This was a \*non-emergency\* urgent care trip.

So my mom outta nowhere today brings up the fact that she hasn't gotten laid in a while. She's 68 and my dad's in his early 70s. I come from an an immigrant (but very open-minded) Asian household so this definitely took me by surprise. But anyway, I asked her questions and she confessed that she couldn't get wet anymore so she has trouble w penetration. I ended up giving her this Aloe Vera lotion/lube that I use to moisturize when it's super dry out (I recently moved to a high altitude city). And I also bought her a lil vibrator so she could... Well, practice. Lol. 

Except I'm in my 20s and have no idea what other advice to give her! I don't know anything about what you experience after menopause, what happens to your hormones and body as you age.... I also don't know what advice to give her if she wants to get dad into this!! We don't know if he's working down there either lolol. Help!

Edit:

You are all so wonderful and lovely. So many supportive messages and I've learned so much in a short period of time. I've copied my comment I made in the r/menopause sub. This is what I've learned so far from all of you and want to make sure that I'm understanding it all correctly!


1) Have mom see a gyno and get professional help. Unfortunately with covid and their age/health, that sadly can't happen as soon as we want to but an appointment has been scheduled for late spring! 

2) Until then, invest in some Hyaluronic Acid. I was able to get some Good Clean Love BioNourish Moisturizing Gel. This is used to help with dryness and atrophy (which is basically the vagina cells deteriorating due to age, menopause, and decrease in sexual activity). So this is kind of like an every day lotion to keep your vagina nice and happy. This is not a substitute from lube. 

3) Have mom self-stimulate for the time being to get ""back into it"". She wants to test the waters herself first before getting dad involved. I got her a vibrator and she seems to be more interested in clitoral stimulation than penetration (which is good baby steps anyway!) If she's not going in, do we need lube?? Or will the Hyaluronic moisturizing gel be enough? We got both just in case but don't want her to be making a whole mess üòÇ

4) if penetrating sex were to be the next step (which won't be anytime soon), there will be a LOT of precautions we need to take. Because the vagina has undergone atrophy, the walls will be thin and prone to pain and damage. Meaning we can't do anything here until we go see a Gyno/Pelvic therapist. Hypothetically, they may prescribe estrogen cream or other things that could best case scenario help bring back mom's vagina to life, or worst case scenario, it's super painful and we will figure an alternative from there! 

Please give me any critiques or suggestions! I'm laying this out as i want to ensure I'm understanding this all correctly when I translate this to my mom.

I have tried so many treatments for BV.. I went to the doctor so many times and they always prescribe me antibiotics that work only for the duration of the medication course.

I tried boric acid suppositories but they only gave temporary relief. I tried taking a 90 billion probiotic daily for months but it didnt do anything (I think the probiotics were not surviving inside me).

I thought I will experiment with eating yoghurt before taking my probiotic pill. I just have plain low fat yogurt and then I take my 90 billion womens pro biotic every day in the morning.

I have started doing this for one week only and I would say my symptoms have reduced by around 60% ! The dreaded smell has thankfully reduced a lot and the discharge amount is also much less! I have faith that if I continue with this it might finally cure my BV by slowly and consistently re-culturing my gut with good bacteria. I think yogurt is basically a REALLY good vessel for the bacteria.

I tried multiple rounds of medications including long term treatment plans with my doctor and i am having little to no relief.

I finally booked in to see a gynaecologist yesterday and after explaining all the treatments i have tried and how much pain and discomfort i am in she told me i need to lower my expectations, we probably won‚Äôt be able to stop it coming back but we will try to manage the symptoms.

I am only 25 and i am being told i will just have to manage the symptoms. I am out thousands of dollars from trying to treat this. I am feeling so defeated.

I can‚Äôt go to the gym, i can‚Äôt walk my dogs, I can‚Äôt go camping as I don‚Äôt have access to showers or toilets where we go, I can‚Äôt go out on our boat as moving in and around the boat cause flare ups.

I've been big my whole life but I hit my highest weight last summer. 5'2"" 248lbs about a size 22/24. About that time I was starting to get massive headaches and I was diagnosed with Idiopathic intracranial hypertension. My doctor said it was really time to consider losing weight. She's so great and as long as my numbers were good, she didn't bother me too much about my being heavy, but this was 100% caused by age and weight. I'm currently down 45 lbs with a goal of 100 by next summer. 

Last night I was taking a shower and felt something weird while I was washing my labia. I thought it was a piece of synthetic braiding hair (weave/extensions) or a piece of a panty liner or tampon since I just finished my period and had braided my hair recently. 

SO I PULLED IT. 

It was, you guessed it, my IUD strings. I could never feel them before because the way my fat was distributed, I had lost some range of motion in my arms. I was also able to put my leg up on the tub when I shower again. When I realized it wasn't coming out without a fight,  it dawned on me what it was and I left it alone About 10 minutes later I feel the cramps starting. I wake up this morning and I have cramps but it also feels like I'm wearing a spiky tampon that wouldn't go all the way in. First thing in the morning I make an appointment to get it checked. Doc said I dislodged it alright and that it was sitting all wonky up against my cervix and he couldn't believe I'd gone to work like this. It hurt to sit too long, but I would get up to walk periodically.

He pulls it out and asks how I liked it or if I wanted to switch to something else like the paraguard.  I jokingly said, ""can you just tie my tubes and call it a day"" and he flips through my chart and says, ""If that's what you want, it's irreversible, but I'm sure you know if you're wanting to have a kid. Get scheduled for a pre-op eval on your way out"". 

My mouth was on the floor.  I don't have kids and haven't ever wanted them, but he didn't even question that. I said I thought it would be harder to convince him and he said, ""well you're almost 37, You know if you want ever be pregnant. If you were 19, I'd be hesitant. I'd still do it, but I'd make you take time to think about it."" And just like that,  I'm scheduled for a tubal ligation. I don't think it would have happened if I hadn't lost that weight.

My infection came back as completely resistant to metronidazole (Flagyl) and highly resistant to Tinidazole the only other option for treatment in the United States. There is one more treatment regimen for me to try. If this fails I am looking at having to deal with trich for the rest of my life.

This would mean never having sex again. It also means I will never be able to have a child. The likelihood of me being able to adopt is also slim to none. The worst part of this is the daily pain and the toll this is taking on my already fragile mental health.

A few weeks ago, I had to go to the airport to pick up a package after work. As I was standing at the counter dealing with customs I noticed a soldier and a young woman, both in their early 20s, sitting on a bench. She was holding a dishevelled Welcome Home sign and both looked terribly dejected. The counter person told me their flight home had been cancelled and the next wasn't until 11ish the next morning. He'd found this out when he charged their phone for them. The young lady had flown in to surprise her husband and had a party waiting at home.

As I was finishing up my business, I saw the girl heading for the loo. She looked so distraught I thought she might welcome a bit of support. It seems they'd been married less than a month before he was deployed. He'd been gone for a year and this was her big romantic surprise, months in the planning, and it had all fallen apart after all the saving up for her plane ticket and all. It seems they were due to move to his new posting and needed all their money for the move. All they could do was stay at the airport until their flight. I did my best to make her feel better but seeing this young love's joy thwarted by circumstance broke my heart. We chatted on a bit before she returned to snuggle in beside her soldier again.

I returned to the counter, picked up my package, and started for my car before something inside just said, ""**No!**"" I walked over to the couple and offered them a hotel room on me for the night. I insisted that it would be on me as a thank you both for his service and as a belated wedding present. Back and forth, back and forth, and next we knew we were at the hotel our company used for business guests. I told the concierge to put dinner, the room, and breakfast on my card. We hugged and said our goodbyes and I felt wonderful for days. And still do when I think about it.

Today, my card statement came. Total charge: $22. I called the hotel. It seems someone in the dining room picked up their dinner. Someone else paid for their room. And a third guest paid for their breakfast. I paid for the room cleaning tip. People ask me why I want to be an American citizen. THIS is just one of the reasons. I'm told they sent a thank you letter and pictures of their new home to me at the freight office. It will be a day or two before I receive it, but all that will do is extend the happiness I have in the real America, not the America of the politicians. Sometimes giving support to another woman in distress, no matter how big or small, can do more for you than you'd ever expect. Allow yourself to feel as wonderful as I do. Please help if you can.

I made a post yesterday on a booktuber""s (book review and discussion youtuber) subreddit to point out that a lot if the genres that he talks about, and even some of the books he endorses, are filled with misogyny or just seem to not acknowledge that women exist and are humans with normal human thoughts and emotions. I said that it'd be great if he came up with a set of books that are specifically woman-friendly, because, you know, we're a huge portion of the population and deserve novels that aren't bigoted against us??

""You can't expect a male to be able to understand how (in your words) ""the poor or, frankly, antagonistic takes on female characters by authors effects the experience for women readers."" I can't speak for Daniel or any other male but that is something that does not even come close to crossing my mind when reading.""

jcvjit,Healthyhooha,1602943018.0,"Hello friends,

Edited EDIT *sigh*: I realized that it may not be clear that we DO allow NSFW photos here for users over the age of 18, but the rule broken most often is the one that states *it must be linked in the comments*. As in, make a text post about it, and then comment on your own post with the photo link. 

We don‚Äôt want any photos popping up in the main feed even if they are blurred. They don‚Äôt always reliably blur on all versions of Reddit. We prefer the community have to go through a few clicks to actually get to them if they‚Äôd like to offer advice or feedback. 

I‚Äôd also like to say that I almost always end up looking at the photos posted, especially the recent ones, and the overwhelming majority of the time, what is pictured is 100% NORMAL. And this is exactly *why* we continue to allow them- for all of us to normalize our bodies. 

The AutoMod that will instantly filter direct photos AND photo links in posts is up and running. It will remove them from the main feed instantly, send it to our modqueue for review (in case other things get caught, like a regular link to a website or something, in which case we could approve it), and post an automatic comment informing the OP that it was removed, why, and what to do about it.

I'm also adding in a sidebar rule for inclusive language. The mods had discussed this in the past few months but hadn't gotten around to implementing it - apologies for that. For example, we prefer that if you start your post with some sort of greeting, that it needs to be gender neutral. Meaning - we are here for trans men and any sort of gender-nonconforming individuals that have vaginas. It's super tempting to start a post with ""Hey ladies, need help with xyz!"" but that needs to either be skipped altogether, or use something like ""friends"" or something similar. We also won't tolerate any downvoting of posts or comments from individuals who identify as something besides ""woman"". The text of the rule will be as follows (thanks to u/theadedb for the text):

""The mod team would like to give an emphatic reminder that this community was created to help all people who have vaginas and vulvas regardless of gender identity or expression. This sub purposefully uses gender neutral language to create a welcoming environment for all users. Any downvoting or negative comments related to someone‚Äôs gender identity or expression will not be tolerated.""

We have some other fun ideas being processed too (think AMAs and Megathreads, like some of the big subs do!), but I want to converse with the mods first.

This particular time, the ingrown was so deep into the skin and it was getting bigger. It quite possibly was on it‚Äôs way to being a big problem. I had to have surgery before because an ingrown hair turned into a large abscess. I was not going back. 

I attempted to use an acne wash and toner with salicylic acid. It helped to bring the pus up to the surface, but the skin was still smooth like a baby. I used Hibiclens, an antibacterial skin wash, to keep the bacteria and dirt at bay. Bump still refuses to go down.

Finally, on day 5 of battle, I saw something about baking soda reducing redness and irritation. Definitely wanted that because the bump hurt. I did it before bed.

I mixed baking soda with water, and used a napkin to dab it on and around the bump. It helped with the irritation and redness within 10 minutes. Rinsed it off.

I just checked it 5 hours later - and the bump finally busted and released the pus! It‚Äôs gone down extremely well. I guess the baking soda helped release it from that last layer of skin.

m7tc8f,Periods,1616081429.0,"So today was the first time in my life my period pain was taken seriously. I tried to be listened to for more than 10 years and I was always being told that every woman goes through pain and that it's normal.

My period are 12 days long and I can't walk or get out of my bed for 2 to 3 days when I have pain. I have to miss work (or school when I was younger) every month. I cry, I have nausea and pass out from the pain once in a while.

My last period was the worst of my life. I was in so much pain I could not even move a muscle, cry or talk. I passed out from it. It was easily a 10/10 pain. I had stopped trying to get listened to for the last 3 years because I thought it was a lost cause, but having this horrible pain made me realize I should fight to be listened to. So yesterday I talked with a super sweet nurse but she told me I had no choice but to pledge my case to a GP if I want to ba able to see a gynecologist (I live in Quebec). So she told me all the things I should mention to the GP to be listened to, and it worked! Here are the tips she gave me:

\- Start by mentioning that you tried to get help on many occasions but nobody wants to help you.

\- Mention how long your period lasts (in my case, 12 days) and that you know that period this long is not normal

\- Mention the number of days you are in pain, tell them the pain can go up to X/10

\- Describe the pain in details so they can live it. In my case, I told them I was bedridden (the nurse insisted it was important to use this term) for 2 to 3 days every month, I told them I had to miss work every month, that I'm non-functional, can't walk, crying, stabbing pain that goes down to my legs, nauseas, passing out, hot flashes.

\- Tell them how the pain affects you. Example: I can't go to work and can't walk. (thanks to unknowncalicocat for pointing that out)

She also told me to keep fighting, and that if the next GP doesn't believe me, to go to the next one until someone wants to help me.

Also, my sister pointed to me a resource of all the female-friendly gynecologists in Quebec: [http://gynecopositive.com/en/home/](http://gynecopositive.com/en/home/). If the GP would not have listened to me that was my backup.

I know I'm far from being the only one to have been ignored for so long. Keep fighting and one day someone will want to help you. It's not in your head and you're not exaggerating or attention-seeking. Don't let them talk you down.

amh06q,Healthyhooha,1549133240.0,"Hello! The advice from this community fixed my infection problems, so I thought I'd make a summary post as a thank you. I'm thrilled to finally have a handle on this problem and I hope this post can help someone else.

**Backstory:** Ever since I became sexually active, I would develop an infection. Often I'd get all 3 at once. It didn't matter if it was oral or sex on the pill, it happened every time. Conventional advice like ""pee after sex"" and ""eat yogurt"" did nothing. Before this subreddit, doctors and I were convinced that birth control was the problem. I switched between nearly 10 types of birth control pills and Nexplanon. OBGYNs were not much help - the most useful advice I ever got was to take a probiotic, but that wasn't enough by itself.

## My Regimen

**Every morning**

1.  Take 1x probiotic made for vaginal health. 
2.  Take 2x 500mg D-Mannose.

**Directly after sex**

1. Immediately push fluids out of me. I will also wash my hands and gently scoop anything out of my vagina.
2. Pee.
3. Take 1x 500mg D-Mannose.

**Once per week**

1. Insert 1 vaginal boric acid suppository.

The probiotic targets yeast, the boric acid raises the pH of the vagina to prevent BV, and the D-Mannose makes your bladder walls slippery so no bacteria can stick and cause a UTI. One time I skipped my after-sex thing, and started to feel BV/yeast happening. I put in boric acid at night for 2 nights and that completely fixed it. I know that boric acid is an intense treatment, but I had tried everything else. What works for me may not be necessary for you.

Lemme know if you have any questions!

I get the freezing in panic mode, I even get her boyfriend being a little peeved (in the post she made him seem pretty reasonable, not pissed off).


But what upsets me was all of the men in the comments spouting BS about ""He's just shooting his shot, whats the big deal?"" ""Just say no and move on.""


It reminded me of my post about being inappropriately approached at work, when men were saying the same shit. And so many other posts by women being upset with men's advances. Men just freak in the comment section about how we're being so moody, why are we getting so upset? It's no big deal. It's a compliment. Just say no, what's the big deal?

I want to walk down the street without the construction workers across the street wolf whistling at me!

I want to give my phone number to the people at the doctor's office without worrying that one of them is going to text me from their personal phone to ask me back to their place! I don't want to be afraid of what's going to happen to me when I reject these men.


And men get to go through the world with confidence eithout being objctified and sexualized and leered at and stalked, and then they whine at us when we just want to EXIST in a public space and have that same experience.


MEN DON'T ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO SHOOT THEIR SHOT. Saying that's what they were doing does not excuse their creepy ass behavior! You could have just walked tf away and left me in peace. You could have refrained from texting me. You could have just controlled your damn hormones. You are not entitled to my patience, my acceptance of your advances, my politeness. And I just wish men would get their heads out of their asses and realize what these behaviors do to the women around them.


But no matter how many times we say that its NOT okay in the comments of every post like that, men just can't seem to wrap their heads around the fact that our opinion on the matter is more valid and more important than theirs, and they love to tell us how wrong we are about the horrible experiences we've been through.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSupport/comments/j3wl5k/im_just_so_tired_of_screaming_into_the_wind_that/,I'm just so tired of screaming into the wind that inappropriate advances are not okay,Vent/Discussion Post ,175,30,0.99,nenorei

I have huge clots, bleed through super plus tampons in an hour or two on my worst days, and get cramps that literally bring me to tears.

Again. Yes, *again*. This has happened before. Like, WTF?!  
Adding insult to injury, in the last few years I've started treatment for vulvodynia as well as urethral issues, so between all of this I feel like all I do is suffer through babysitting my fucking vagina and uterus. I can't go on vacation, have spontaneous sex, wear the cute underwear I want, or do anything without worry of how my body will punish me. I've tried tons of birth control, all of which just exacerbates issues I already have, or it creates new ones.

My current bf of almost two years has ruined my life 

Before my bf and I started dating we saw other people. I was seeing one guy and he was seeing one girl. The guy (who was a good friend of mine) only slept with one girl who is as clean as a whistle when it comes to STD health. Now my bf who was seeing this girl before we started dating never told me how often she got around and how he had unprotected sex with her on multiple occasions. He never told me that part until I started feeling bad down there. 

In the June of 2019, which was a few months after we became official, I started feeling awful in my vagina. After months of multiple OB/GYNs telling me it was a yeast infection, one OB/GYN who knew what to test for told me I had Trichomoniasis. I was floored and asked how could I of gotten this? Ive only been with my bf since March. She told me it had to come from somewhere. I was so sad and shaken. I asked my bf if he cheated and he said no, so I asked if he had unprotected sex with that girl and he sighed and admitted he had. I was furious he hid that from me. I called my friend who I slept with to let him know what I had. He told me he had no symptoms and neither did the girl he started seeing at the time. My bf got tested and was negative. I took antibiotics and that was the end of that, or so I thought.

Fast forward to September of this year. I feel weird again. I see an OB/GYN and he tells me I have a YI. Gave me cream and diflucan and nothing worked. About two weeks later he calls and said I have Trich...
I called my bf crying and asked if he cheated on me. He said he hadn‚Äôt and went to get tested, and came back negative. This time they gave him an antibiotic to be on the safe side. 

Fast forward to now, I am miserable. I was tested after my course of Metrodonizole and I no longer have an Trich, but for the past 3 months, I cannot rid of a YI I got from the STD and the antibiotics. I tried creams, boric acid, cutting back sugar, probiotics, and nothing is working. I have thrown so much money at appointments and medications and it is starting to add up.

I am trying so hard to not be mad at my bf because I do love him and it was a careless accident but I cannot help sort of resenting him. I am uncomfortable every minute of every day and have to eat like a rabbit so symptoms of my YI do not get worse. I have such low self-esteem and cry all the time from being fed up of not getting better. I know he feels terrible and tries to help cook non-sugar meals for me but if he didn‚Äôt hide his past, I wouldn‚Äôt be suffering now. 

Has anyone had a successful regime to get rid of YI that won‚Äôt go away? I am so tired...

I looked up yeast infection symptoms, but it didn‚Äôt match. And my gynecologist never said anything like ‚ÄúYou have a yeast infection!‚Äù 

Well I went to my annual Pap smear last week. My gynecologist noticed I had an abnormal amount of discharge and decided to swab for ureaplasma, a type of mycoplasma that affects roughly 80% of women. I came back positive!

Apparently this natural-occurring bacteria can overwhelm the female reproductive and urinary tract and cause issues like UTIs, miscarriages, infertility. However, it‚Äôs not well known. Below are a couple articles I found very helpful and relatable. 

If you experience symptoms like I do and those described in the articles, ask your gynecologist to do a ureaplasma culture!

Is there something about modern life that makes us more susceptible to YIs and BV? I mean a course of antibiotics will do a number on you for a couple of weeks, yeah, but all of this?

I have been seeing a lot of posts saying that people are treating their UTIs at home with things like cranberry juice, rather than being seen by a physician. While it's true that Cranberry juice can *help* a UTI, it should not be used as a **cure.**

I work in infectious disease for a living and I cannot tell you how often I see patients here with insanely dangerous symptoms caused by UTIs; not only physical affects, but affects that can mimic conditions like Schizophrenia. In addition, UTIs that go untreated can lead to more serious conditions like bladder and kidney infections, kidney failure, permanent kidney damage and even sepsis, which is life threatening.

If you suspect you have a UTI, please call your doctor. A UTI doesn't always require urgent or emergency care but you should have a urinalysis performed and take any antibiotics you may be prescribed.

Things we recommend to our patients to help prevent UTIs are urination after sex, drinking plenty of water, maintaining good hygiene down there, wiping from front to back and/or taking a supplement like D-Mannose.

I also have a lot of general pain inside it and a huge lump that sticks out slightly and I'm not sure is supposed to be there. I'm obviously not sexually active but I got more and more paranoid due to my issues. I was also 26 and I remember hearing that everyone who is female should get it checked out every year just in case.

When I made the appointment, the doctor insisted that I needed an ultrasound for the fibroids, which was fair enough. I was really not looking forward to the exam, and when I finally got in to see the doctor, I started crying immediately. She asked me if I was sexually active and I said no. She said in the same tone you'd talk to a small child, ""Then what did you come here for...?"" I tried to explain why I did but she kept talking to me like there was no reason at all for me to be there and I was stupid for coming... When she asked me if I had pain and I said ""yes, a lot"", she seemed to ignore my answer. She didn't want to look inside because I am a virgin so she just looked at the outside and checked my breasts and that was it. I didn't even get the ultrasound that was recommended because they forgot about it and I felt too ashamed to mention it. I specifically asked her about the lump and she said ""it's just tissue"" and left it at that.

Wondering if it really was stupid and unnecessary of me to go in for an exam when I am a virgin :/",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/17o9roh/gynecologist_made_me_feel_like_a_complete_moron/,Gynecologist made me feel like a complete moron,Sexual Health ,168,25,0.98,bigsmellygoblin
13e6808,WomensHealth,1683759647.0,"So I 33yo f was sterilized at 24 after a loss 3 years earlier followed by two healthy pregnancies. When I signed the paperwork I was told I was to have my tubes ‚Äúburned and cut‚Äù, my dr put in filshie clips instead without my knowledge or consent. Within two months, my dr wanted to give me a hysterectomy due to the pain and the clots I had. I refused because I was only 24 and didn‚Äôt want to be on medication for hormones for the rest of my life.   They ran different test and a endo biopsy and everything came back negative. For 8 years i suffered two weeks a month, bed bound due to the crippling pain I was in (hence the endo biopsy and my mom has endo). I started seeking different OBs and they all kept telling me it‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. No, clots the size of half dollars are NOT *normal*. 
Well a little over a year ago, I ended up in the ER due to a kidney stone and the ER dr came into my room and asked if I knew one of my clips had migrated. 
Migrated‚Ä¶.. The left clip broke and was free floating in my pelvic area. I was utterly stunned. I told her no and I had no idea I had clips. 
I ended up going back to my original OB office and asked for a new dr. When I met with said new dr, it was like a breath of fresh air. She listened to me, told me she didn‚Äôt think my periods were ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and it had everything to do with the filshie clips. We scheduled surgery and last August she removed the right clip and both of my tubes. Unfortunately, after 4 hours of being cut open, she was unable to find the left clip. So at this time I have a free floating clip in my body. 
I was gaslit by drs for 8 years and 22 days because I have a period. Ladies, YOU know your body and YOU know when something is wrong. DONT stop fighting for answers. 
I am open to any questions you may have.

12ckvp6,Healthyhooha,1680702306.0,"I've struggled with BV , yeast infections, utis and just sweaty smelly odor in my hooha area.  It's nothing to be ashamed about, we are women it happens to alot of us. But here are some things that have helped me deal / prevent the above. These things worked for me, everyone's bodies are different so I can't guarantee it'll work for your body. 

1) drink alot of water, atleast 8 cups a day. Your pee should be a light yellow, if it's clear then you're drinking too much water. 

2) take a daily probiotic, my doctor recommended me to take any probiotic with atleast a billion cultures in it. **warning ** when you start a new probiotic it can make you go #2 more frequently and sometimes diahhrea, this is normal and it will stop within 3 days to a week of taking the probiotics consistently. Always remember tip #7, wipe front to back. 

3) keep anything with high fragrance away from your hooha.. that includes perfumes, soaps, Douches,  deodorant and I also recommend washing your underwear with unscented or lightly scented detergent. 

4) always go pee before and after sex, even if it's just alittle trinkle... do it. 

5) go commando to bed

6) after you get out of the shower dry off really good (just pat dry your hooha area, don't swipe back and forth ) then lay in your bed on your back and spread eagle.. let your body, especially your hooha cool off and dry naturally.

7) always wipe from front to back, especially after a #2. & I don't recommend baby wipes or any type of alternative to toilet paper.. and steer clear of the scented tp as well. 

8) go to the doctor if your hooha is doing something out of the norm, listen to your body. 

9) make sure to take probiotics while on any antibiotics. 

10) consider changing your diet. If you have alot of sugar or salt intake, decrease it. You can start small and then see how your body reacts. Do this as recommended by your doctor. I am not a physician so I can only give recommendations. Please consult with your doctor before changing your diet if you are on meds for any health problems etc.

11) if you notice that you are getting bv, utis or yeast infections after sex, ask your partner what type of soap they are using.. If they are using any fragrance soap on their parts then ask them to change to a unscented soap.. this small change will make a huge difference for your hooha. 

12) don't insert anything into your hooha as a quick diy treatment. That includes the ""yogurt tampon"" , the boric acid suppository, etc. Trust me it will probably do more harm than good. But I do highly recommend staying away from the suppository because one of my friends tried the boric acid one and it literally burned her vaginal walls and it took her forever to recover.. double ouch. So please avoid. 

13) when mother nature has her monthly visit, stay away from scented tampons and pads, they are a big no no. I recommend getting organic tampons if possible and changing them more frequently if you have bv or a yeast infection while your time of the month. 

14) if you have bv, yeast infection or a uti. Stay away from alcoholic beverages. They have added sugars and will just make it worse, especially if you have a uti. If you must drink, please please please drink a glass of water in between each drink to counter act the sugar intake..trust me, you'll thank me later. 

15) stay away from sodas and diet sodas while having a yeast infection or uti. They have added sugars and salts that make shit worse. If you must drink soda, Try to limit yourself to 1 a day or buy the mini packs of soda and just drink 1 of those IF you must. But try to mostly drink water.

16) stay away from candy and any kind of processed sugar foods. Natural sugars from fruit are okay in moderation. Yeast thrives off of sugar so the less sugar you have in your body the better. 
**disclaimer** changing your diet to no sugar can cause your body to go into shock and can cause your blood sugar to plummet (it happened to me when I first changed my diet) so I recommend keeping some gum or something with small amounts of sugar near you just incase. Now again, consult your doctor before changing your diet drastically. Please consult your doctor! 

17) if you have a uti, don't hold your pee..even if just a little trinkle comes out just let it out. Holding your pee can make your uti worse. 

18) if you have a uti and can't get to a doctor within a day or so I recommend using AZO urinary products.. they help alot with the discomfort until you can get to the doctor. But don't use them as an escape from the doctor, please still see your doctor. 

19) if you are a smoker or if you vape, try to cut back. My doctor told me that vaping and smoking can cause more yeast infections.. I honestly don't know why, its worth a google search though. 

20) when shaving your hooha, try to keep any shaving creams or shaving oils only in your public hair area and rinse very very well after shaving as well. If you moisturize after shaving, I suggest getting a unscented moisturizer for your pubic hair area. 

21) AVOID THONGS . While you have a uti, yeast infection or bv thong underwear will and can make it worse. Please avoid thongs. I recommend cotton boy short underwear or going commando (as long as you aren't on your period). Trust me, just avoid the sexy underwear.

22) if you tend to sweat alot in your groin area, especially if you're at the gym, I suggest going into the bathroom, get a dry paper towel, wet it damp and pat your groin area with the damp paper towel (pat, don't swipe). Then take a dry paper towel and pat completely dry. Try to stay as dry as possible. Yeast and bv thrive in warm moist areas aka the groin so limiting the moisture can help tremendously! It's alot of work but trust me it works, I had to do this alot at the beginning but I felt alot better after I did it. 

23) limit sex while having a yeast infection,  bv or uti. I recommend no sex tbh. 


Hope some of these tips help you as much as they've helped me :)

The trial between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp. Both of these events are causing such a huge stir up of sexism and violent comments towards women and their experiences. It feels so defeating, and for the first time in my life I am truly starting to feel like a second-rate citizen as a woman. 

Our concerns aren't heard. Our stories not listened to. Our health is not a priority. 

It's disgusting to realize how much sexism lives behind closed doors, only for cultural events like these to bring them out in to the open again. I fear for our future. I fear for our autonomy, as it hangs in the balance. Something that self-righteous men have been saying for decades is ""safe.""

qkqkin,WomensHealth,1635808606.0,"I (23F) usually never dare to post stuff on reddit since I like to avoid confrontation. But this time, instead of trying to find a post that is similar to my thoughts, I decided that I'll write one. So here I gooo

As a teenager and then as a woman, I have been through shaving, plucking, waxing, bleaching, laser etc.
It caused me to have lots of ingrown hair, of itchy pimples, small cuts, burns and even infections. 

I have been judged and mocked when I had too much hair on my arms, for the brown hair on my belly or if I didn't shave my legs. I grew up with these standards and I have seen tons and tons of ads about all the imaginable ways of getting rid of women bodyhair.. 

In porn industry, they shave everything as well and it somewhat influence women and men in real life.
So like almost every women, I have worked almost everyday to maintain a hairless body. 
It was time and energy consuming. And very expensive.
I grew up in this society feeling uncomfortable with myself, feeling like I had to hide parts of myself to fit and to be loved.

I remember the first woman I have seen that wasn't shaving. She was not crazy or retarded. She was in fact extremely sane and very comfortable with her body. Using only natural and cruelty free products.
I was 18 at the time and the first time I saw her armpits I was DISGUSTED. Why tho? She was very clean. But even if I was also a woman, I didn't relate and I rejected her like everyone else. 

Now here I am at 23. I think I finally understood. 
You know that feeling when you know something had changed in you and you know there is no going back. That's how I felt today
I got out of the shower. And I shaved my legs and ladyparts for the first time in a month.
I am not against women that shaves if they like it or if they don't like too much hair. But I feel like everyone should be free to choose and be treated JUST THE SAME.
Cause they both have as much value and deserve to be and feel accepted.

So as I was saying, I got out of shower and I looked at myself naked in the mirror 
And I was like... Why does society want women to shave? Why does it matter? Just Why? That's not natural.
Body hair is what differentiate women from little girls. I was looking at my ladyparts and didn‚Äôt really feel like a woman, more like me when I was 10.
Take the lady parts by exemple, the biggest difference is actually the bodyhair. It's really beautiful and should be appreciated because that's how a woman is, that's how a woman naturally looks like.

And there is also a reason that we have body hair, especially on the ladyparts. 
Pubic hair is a sign of sexual maturity. It reduces friction during sexual intercourse, it helps stop bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body, it traps dirt and pathogens that may enter the body through the vagina.
So pubic hair is not unhygienic. It's normal and should be treated AS SUCH.

I don‚Äôt know if it was my partner‚Äôs skin microbiome, his semen, or what, but I started having a slight smell when I went longer than 24 hours without a shower. And my discharge became thicker and whiter. 

This issue has persisted for years. I thought it was normal. Sometimes it would get worse; itchiness, a bad odor (I got tested for bacterial vaginosis and it came back negative), ‚Äúchunks‚Äù in my discharge (I am sorry for TMI). I was so embarrassed, especially when my boyfriend would wipe thick white discharge off his member or I could smell my vagina through my jeans. 

I put a boric acid suppository in my vagina last week after reading a thread on Reddit about it. I know it sounds dangerous, but I was tired. And some medical articles online did cite it as an ‚Äúalternative‚Äù treatment for yeast infections and BV. 

And my god. It freaking worked. 

My vagina has no smell. None. Even after a day without showering. My discharge is clear, thin, and slippery; I can‚Äôt remember the last time it was like that when I wasn‚Äôt ovulating. I feel good.

I‚Äôm a biologist and I‚Äôm guessing it is because the natural pH of my vagina was restored. Vaginas are acidic and boric acid is‚Ä¶ an acid. Go figure.

o6hsxs,WomensHealth,1624469738.0,"I posted a couple months back about a lump in my breast that appeared cancerous in my breast, and I was hoping it wasn‚Äôt cancer. Well, it‚Äôs confirmed, it is cancer. I was diagnosed pretty quickly and have already had surgery (lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy). Chemo was originally not part of my treatment plan because we caught it early (before it went into the nodes) and it was small, but after genome testing, it was discovered that it‚Äôs a pretty aggressive cancer that‚Äôs a little more likely to come back so I‚Äôll be starting chemo soon, after a round of embryo freezing since my husband and I would like to try for a baby in the future (it‚Äôs very important to me, and overall, my prognosis is very good/low risk of coming back). 

I‚Äôm also posting this not to scare people, but for two reasons - 1) don‚Äôt put off getting lumps checked out. I went right away and we caught it early. Had I waited, the cancer was likely preparing to spread and my prognosis might not be as good/my treatment would have been more aggressive. And 2) the first few weeks after diagnosis was hard because I was terrified, but as I met with my doctors, I found out that many breast cancers are treatable or even curable. Armed with a treatment plan, I felt a lot better. So just know, if you‚Äôre going through this, it does get easier. And if you‚Äôre young like me, there are options for fertility preservation (there‚Äôs a shot you can get to help save your ovaries plus egg/embryo freezing). Not everyone needs chemo either, so there‚Äôs that too. 

My exact cancer is hormone positive (it responds to hormones) and her2 negative (a type of cancer that can be more aggressive). I‚Äôll have a short round of TC chemo - Taxol and Cytoxan followed by four weeks of radiation. I‚Äôll be on hormone blockers for 5-10 years but allowed to pause it in order to have a baby and the doctors believe it‚Äôs safe for me to do that. My oncologist says I‚Äôm still at low risk of recurrence and my risks of it coming back, after chemo, is less than 10%.

k5e1qb,WomensHealth,1606930905.0,"Hi, everyone. I am that girl who went from worrying about her ovary already being dead to finding out that she had ovarian cancer. I know its been a while, but I'm here with another update.

So...this one is more emotional than my previous ones. So much has happened, and it is insane...please let me know if this particular post doesn't belong on womenshealth, and I will quickly move it. I just...its becoming too much, and I feel like typing may help me process this...may as well give an update while I'm at it.

I got that second lung-draining I was mentioning in the last post, and holy cow was it awful...the appointment I thought would be an ultrasound to monitor it was actually the draining itself. Instead of it being done at the hospital this time, it was done at a nearby pulmonary clinic, so when my friend who went with me warned them that I was a screamer, they had no idea how serious it was. It wasn't pleasant; for me, or the doctor and nurses working on me.

I clung to my friend like a spider monkey throughout all of this as she literally had her arms around me to make sure I did not jolt, and my brain was in hyperdrive. At some point, the doctor stopped administering the numbing agent (after extra doses) and prodded the area gently, realizing that my fear also made the area hypersensitive to touch (I vaguely remember him asking my friend if she thought this was due to fear or pain, and my friend replied ""both"". By the time the catheter went in and the draining started, all the room was spinning and I was struggling to stay conscious; I found out from my friend that the nurses started worrying about whether or not I was going to vomit, and they all relaxed slightly when they realized I was just about to pass out. I...had never gotten to that point before. By the time it was finished, they had me rest until I could actually move safely and we surveyed the damage; I was dehydrated from sweating so much, and I kept apologizing to my friend for coating her in it as I tried to get some water in me. The doctor came in with a chuckle and said that he is pretty sure I scared off some patients. We all hope I never have to go in for another one. So that was my second-ever lung draining...fun.

These past couple of weeks, we have had my mother staying at my great aunt's and uncle's...her side. My great-aunt is completely and utterly senile and...senile or not, not a nice person. My great-uncle was at the point where he can't take care of her, but utterly refused care for her. So...for a while, my mother was their caretaker...it seemed to be working out fine.

We...we had Thanksgiving there, and she was fine. She seemed...better than I had ever seen her. She was so excited to see me, gave me so many hugs...I was worried the day would be incredibly awkward and uncomfortable but...it was a good day.

Two days later...she was gone...

After Thanksgiving she had been ill, but according to her and my great-uncle, it was just some nausea and vomiting. No fever, nothing that could have been led to this. We all figured she had a bit of food poisoning. Sunday, we noticed we hadn't gotten any texts from her, and she wasn't answering calls...odd, considering she was usually so, so quick to answer. Sunday afternoon my father and I checked in on her...it looked like she was asleep on her stomach, but she was cold...

We are reeling...we don't know what to think about this. Things were so complicated before this happened, so many mixed feelings due to so many events that just melted away. She was Mom. Now she is gone...and all myself, my father, and my siblings know is we would give anything to have her back. It hurts so bad...this hurts worse than anything the cancer has done to me.

We...we are still waiting on the rest of the test results, and we hope we can at least find an answer as to...why...why her? She was still young...she was in her 40s, and there was absolutely no sign of this happening.

jl6b2v,WomensHealth,1604095554.0,"I still can't get over how dehumanizing today's doctor's visit was....

I went to my doctor who I have been seeing since practically birth to get a blood test because I'm supposed to start Accutane soon. My doctor immediately turned hostile and started questioning why I would even consider such a dangerous medication. I told him I already discussed this with my dermatologist and had time to think this through (which I do not think it is dangerous, btw). He started asking me if I tried other solutions for my acne, which fine, but I wasn't coming in to discuss alternatives because I already made my mind up.

He then asked me if I take any other medication, to which I said the birth control pill. He once again was shocked and appalled. He told me that the pill is also dangerous and one day I am going to want children and will be infertile because of it. He said gynecologists give out the pill because it's a moneymaker, not because it's good for women's health. I was getting obviously frustrated because I was not here to talk about that. Really though, that wasn't the worst.

The worst came when he asked if I am sexually active. I hesitated but told him yes, and that was clearly my mistake believing that I could disclose that and not be judged. The first question he asked me was if I was married?! Or if I am planning on it soon? Err.. no and I am not? He then proceeded to ask if I have single or multiple partners, which that should be a fine question to ask a patient, but I knew he was prying to keep judging. I told him I'm in a stable relationship. He then goes on to give me a long lecture about how I should not be having premarital sex. I AM 22. At this point, I burst into tears because I felt humiliated and powerless to do or say anything. He continues lecturing me saying that if my boyfriend truly loves me, then he would not sleep with me. He also talked about divorce rates and that me sleeping with my boyfriend is jeopardizing our chance at a stable marriage in the future. He then begs me to rethink my stance on sex and to not do it anymore until I am married. I was biting my lip the entire time because I was ready to explode and walk out of there. I started lying to questions, such as if I slept with multiple people throughout my lifetime and how many years I've been having sex because I felt so ashamed. I no longer could be honest with him. 

The next worst part is I need to see him to pick up my results from the blood test next week and I am terrified of what he is going to ask me. I can't really change my doctor because my family goes to him and likes his ""traditional and honest"" approach to medicine. I can't tell my parents either because I come from a culture where this topic is forbidden, and my parents would side with him. Okay, fine, I can take it from my parents, but I shouldn't have to feel this way with my doctor. I still feel so disgusted and degraded. I don't know how to process all of this. No woman should EVER have to go through this because let's be real, this conversation would have never occurred with a male patient. 

TLDR: Went in for a blood test. Instead got shamed for choosing to take Accutane, birth control pill, and ESPECIALLY for having premarital sex. Felt embarrassed, ashamed, humiliated, degraded, etc. and still do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/jl6b2v/today_i_had_the_worst_and_most_humiliating/,Today I had the worst and most humiliating doctor's visit of my life,,166,35,0.97,lawschoolkat

I‚Äôve seen a lot of people recently talking about issues that could be related to a tight/ weak pelvic floor. Trouble peeing after sex, uncomfortably tight vag, pain during sex
Pain is NEVER NORMAL. 

Also most of us sit all day and have weak, elongated butt and back muscles. This will give you poor posture and put pressure on your pelvic floor which is a recipe for all sorts of issues. 

If you ever give birth it will make the process and recovery much harder. You might experience back pain. You might have cramps around your vulva and be unable to relax your perineum in order to have sex painlessly. People can get prolapse as they age. 

If your lower back has a deep curve to it, you‚Äôre putting a ton of pressure on your vagina. If you slouch while sitting or sit on your tailbone, you are doing damage. 

For your own sake do squats. Do some light lifting. Walk. Get your back and butt strong. Get used to sitting and standing tall.

 What discs do you lovey people recommend?

So I‚Äôm getting married in less than a month (27 days to go!!!!!! Yay!!!!!!!) and of course My period tracker is predicting me to either start my period on my wedding day or the day after. 
 ( sobbing when I think about it. I saved myself for marriage and my first experiences will be while cramping and bleeding!?!? It‚Äôs so disheartening )( ugh So if anyone knows of a way to make this coming cycle about 5 days shorter without using hormonal birth control or any other kind of hormonal medicine I would totally jump on that.(( I‚Äôm not comfortable using anything hormonal we will be using barriers and fertility awareness for birth control )) I‚Äôm also due to start today by the way) 


I‚Äôve never had to worry about sex before let alone sex during the cramping and bleeding stage. So this is all completely foreign to me. 


I‚Äôve seen commercials for disks that are good for sex during the actively bleeding faze and before I just buy whatever I can find on Amazon for a decent price with good reviews. I wanted to get some feedback from others who would have experience with them. I‚Äôm also aware the Amazon sellers buy fake reviews so I can‚Äôt count on them all being truthful. 

I‚Äôm 35 years old and started with a diva size 1 over 10 years ago and instantly loved it. I lost my diva cup after a few years and bought a menstro soft cup which I have been using for 6 years now and it‚Äôs still going strong ( I can‚Äôt find them on Amazon anymore sadly, or I would link it for you since I think it‚Äôs a great cup )  I also bought and tried the pixie cup size 2 a few years ago but found it to be uncomfortable, so I went back to the smaller menstro cup. I guess turning 30 didn‚Äôt magically make me need a bigger size lol. 

My questions are:

How is sizing a disk different than a cup? 


What should I look for when reading reviews on specific ones?

Since I like a soft cup should I look for a soft disc? 

What discs do your partners like best? 



 [this listing has 2 sizes included](CareCup Menstrual Disc - Set of 2 Reusable Period Discs - Premium Design with Soft, Flexible, Medical-Grade Silicone + 1 Storage Bag (1 Small + 1 Large) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096PZZNGR/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_FJ35AKF3STXCT3GZ4MHN) 

So would that be good to get for the wedding night/honeymoon? That way if one doesn‚Äôt work I can try the other size without the waiting for a new purchase to arrive?  It‚Äôs listed as soft and while that seems to be a negative for some reviewers others prefer it. It only has 8 reviews but they look authentic and are overall positive. 


Or should I go for [this one](MOONTHLIES Menstrual Disc - Reusable Period Disc - Starter Set of 2 Sizes - Tampon, Pad and Cup Alternative https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XQZJZNM/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_Q22M864093RZSN51164R) ? 

Since it has more reviews and also gives you 2 sizes? It‚Äôs over twice the cost than the other listing and described as firmer  I also think it costs so much more because it seems to have more engineering put into it. So that might be a better option. 

I‚Äôm just so indecisive since I‚Äôve loved my cups for so long and I don‚Äôt know the first thing about what to look for in a disc. 

Maybe I can buy both and try the cheaper ones first?  

Keeping the others as backup if they don‚Äôt work out. So that way I don‚Äôt have to worry about waiting for an order to come and missing out on really enjoying my honeymoon. If the cheaper one do work great I can return the more expensive unopened. 

Or should I look for ones that are specifically advertised as great for sex? Is there anything that would make one better during sex than another? 


I‚Äôm a bit worried about it grossing out my new husband ( he is also a virgin, but we have openly discussed my cycle as a whole and that I‚Äôm probably going to be bleeding on the wedding night or on the honeymoon. So don‚Äôt worry he isn‚Äôt going in blind.  He has been very understanding and would never say anything if he was put off by period blood.

The reason I'm wondering if this is what triggered it is because the only time in my life that my period was mostly regular other than when I was on birth control was when I was sexually active. Once I stopped having sex, my period pretty much disappeared again until I got back on bc (which I stopped taking not long after). Does anyone have any info or related stories on this?

g2i41w,WomensHealth,1587054234.0,"I've seen so many posts in r/womenshealth the last few weeks about people stressing over ""missed"" periods and wondering if they're pregnant (even if they haven't had sex in months!) so I thought it would be worth just making a Public Service Announcement.  


**Our bodies can be highly sensitive to stress.**  


If your body has reason to think that the outside world is stressful or uncertain at the moment, it is likely to DELAY ovulation this month.  That means that if you are more stressed than normal (global pandemic, anyone) or if you have changed your sleeping habits (sleeping more or less, sleeping with the tv on etc. etc.), of your eating habits, or your exercise habits etc. etc. etc-----then it is HIGHLY likely that you're going to see a change in your normal menstrual cycle.   


Basically, your body may decide to hold off on releasing an egg until either things return to normal or your ""new normal"" becomes more routine.  That can mean that your ovulation gets pushed back by days or weeks---and when ovulation is delayed, your period will be equally delayed.   


So let's say you have a 28 day cycle:  if you normally ovulate on Day 14 and don't ovulate until Day 20....your period ain't going to show up on Day 28 that month. Instead, it'll be arriving around Day 34.  The time between your period starting and ovulation is HIGHLY variable, but the time between ovulation and menstruation is very CONSISTENT.  If there is any change to your cycle, it will almost definitely happen BEFORE ovulation.   


That means that there's very little you can do to ""induce"" a period, apart from trying to be as zen as possible to lull your body into ovulation and starting the whole process that leads to your period.    


In short: don't be too worried if your period is late this month. And if you want some extra reassurance, look into ways you can keep track of ovulation because that will be the best way to determine if you are truly ""late"" for your period (14+ days after ovulation) or if you are simply experiencing delayed ovulation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/g2i41w/psa_expect_delayed_periods_during_the_pandemic/,PSA: Expect Delayed Periods During the Pandemic,,164,22,1.0,Pleasant-Present
18ldnmk,Healthyhooha,1702919035.0,"I was sexually abused as a toddler and the pain experienced from that means I can‚Äôt touch my clit directly without associating it with what happened. 
My clit hood is also pretty small, and doesn‚Äôt pull back all the way over my clit. 

This means that I get pearls of smegma built up under my clit hood that I need to wash away. Sometimes I can do it fine by running water over my clit once I‚Äôve pulled back the hood as far as it will go. But sometimes I need to use a finger to brush away discharge / smegma build up under the hood, or gently pull the hood back and forth to get the smegma out. 

This means touching my clit directly, and when I do that, I end up passing out because of my trauma.

If I don‚Äôt touch my clit to remove build up, the smegma builds up and it gets really painful and uncomfortable.

so i‚Äôve been dealing with (what i thought) was a yeast infection for about 7 months now. 7 months, 5 doctors, 9 appointments later still no relief. I posted about it last week and a lot of people recommended doing a full fungal/bacterial culture to figure out what was really going on, since it hasn‚Äôt responded to fluconozole or other antifungals. I had a gyn appointment today so I called last week to make sure that they would be able to do these tests and emphasized that I‚Äôd be leaving for a month the week after the appointment so really needed to take these tests at that appointment. I was assured that I could have ‚Äúany test I wanted‚Äù done at the appointment. Fast forward to today and the gyn is about to do the same swab for 2 strains of yeast, BV, and trichomonis that I‚Äôd already taken and gotten negative results from (edit: surprise surprise, it came back negative again‚ò∫Ô∏è). When I asked about the full fungal/bacterial cultures she told me that they DIDN‚ÄôT HAVE THE RIGHT TUBES TO RUN THESE TESTS. I told her that I‚Äôd called a week earlier just to make sure that I would be able to do full cultures and she just shrugged. I also asked about cytolytic vaginosis (i‚Äôve noticed the itching isn‚Äôt quite as bad on my period) and she said she‚Äôd never heard of it and that it was ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù to have too much of the good bacteria. At this point I‚Äôm just so frustrated and wondering if this is grounds to file a complaint?

v997xz,Healthyhooha,1654871926.0,"I wanted to share my recent experiences about two pelvic procedures I had and why one was traumatic and why one couldn‚Äôt have possibly gone better. Both doctors knew about my SA history and it was discussed before both procedures began.


The first one was an egg retrieval for IVF. This one had me start in a different little room where a nurse failed to get an IV in my hand, so the anesthesiologist was called in early to place my IV. He was very unsympathetic and clinical. My doctor asked me what they needed to do for me in the room when I reminded her about my past and I told her I wanted to know the role of everyone in the room and have a female nurse by my side while being put under. I *really* didn‚Äôt think I needed to specify to not expose my vagina to the entire room.   


Once I was taken into the room they had me lay on a small half-sized exam table that had the big industrial leg stirrups like you find for L&D. The nurse had me open the back of my gown at this point and didn‚Äôt help me not show my bare ass to the open door behind me. So I was already uncomfortable but just tried quickly to settle on the table. I was handed a paper sheet to cover myself. Now lots of other people entered and were talking around me but not to me. The anesthesiologist began to prep his meds. The nurse had me put my legs in the stirrups and got me spread as far as I could without it hurting and then she *threw up my sheet*. I began crying and tried to cover my vagina and she wouldn‚Äôt help me! I couldn‚Äôt get the sheet back over myself and was now having an anxiety attack so I couldn‚Äôt speak and just desperately trying to cover myself with my hand. Then the anesthesiologist administered the burning propofol while I was still desperately trying to not expose myself. It was horrible and very traumatic. I cried myself to sleep that night and had flashbacks every time I showered for a week. Just awful.   


My other procedure was yesterday. This was a surgery to remove excess scar tissue from my birth tear that was causing lots of pain. We had already tried every type of medication, cream, lidocaine jelly, and pelvic PT for two years before this. This time we did everything in the procedure room. They had me undress only from the waist down and gave me a fleece blanket to cover with. I felt so much more comfortable still being in my bra/shirt and having the thicker blanket instead of a paper sheet. Instead of a little half table I sat on a chair that had a leg rest come out from under me. They reclined me a bit and then the anesthesiologist came in. He gave me a lidocaine shot first! He said he understood hand IVs could be painful and the propofol medication burns so he likes to make his patients comfortable. Best anesthesiologist ever! He also made lots of jokes with me. Once I was numb he gave me the IV. They introduced everyone‚Äôs name and role to me. And I was put out just in that reclined position. They didn‚Äôt uncover me or put me in stirrups until *after* I was unconscious! This all was literally the best case scenario possible I could imagine. I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing. *That* is how you handle an anxious SA survivor for a pelvic procedure! Don‚Äôt traumatically expose and ignore.

I‚Äôve heard anal shouldn‚Äôt cause pain or issues like this so it must be because I wasn‚Äôt prepared and he‚Äôs thicker too. Overall I feel violated but has anyone else felt loose like this or developed a lump after anal?

Imagine my surprised pleasure when that is one of the key factors to this device. You play the games by tightening and relaxing. It measures both and you score by being able to do both.

Working with my school and community, FreetheFlow has raised over $700 dollars in monetary donations and has collected over 3,000 feminine hygiene products (pads, tampons, etc).¬†

Although overlooked, the inability to access and afford pads and tampons is one of the biggest problems for low-income and homeless menstruators.

And, when homeless menstruators cannot afford products, they often turn to the use of any cloth material they can find; this puts them at risk of different infections.¬†

Right now, during COVID-19, the need for feminine hygiene products has increased as periods do not stop for pandemics.¬†

Perhaps I worded my question wrong but I am not debating the need of the antibiotic if that is what the provider prescribes‚Äî having been a mother for 10 years, this is the first UTI we‚Äôve had to deal with and it has been distressing to all.

Shit, y‚Äôall made me feel like a terrible mother for simply seeking some moral support that this is normal - a little bit of compassion would have gone a long way. I myself have been subject to over prescribed antibiotics which have caused me long term grief.

**UPDATE** : **MOTHERS INTUITION!!** My daughter did NOT in fact have a UTI and we‚Äôve been treating her with the prescribed antibiotic (Bactrim) for the past 3 days - for a UTI she did not have.

The cultures came back positive for bacterial vaginosis (no yeast detected) and have been prescribed a 10-day course of Flagyl (I have no experience with this antibiotic and was not aware it had to be compounded). THIS is why I came here to ask about her symptoms because she had no pain and lots of discharge- it was her vagina attempting to clean itself.

Then she proceeded to say she couldn't see anything, and I told her she actually had to retract the hood like I stated. She still said she couldn't see anything and gave me a mirror so I showed her the keratin pearls that are under the skin which I was not able to free myself. After poking around with a dry qtip she then said since I have pain due to increased blood flow there when I get aroused I should use topical lidocaine and not ""prod"" myself down there. She also said to take a baking soda bath to ""even things out"" which sounds like a horrible idea to me? I have gotten yeast infections from lush bath bombs in the past which contain baking soda. The next thing she prescribed was topical estrogen cream but I have a blood clotting disorder and the website says not to use it if you have that, but she said ""it doesn't work the same way"" and I'll be fine.

k05ufw,WomensHealth,1606227702.0,"Long-time user of Fertility Awareness over here just wanting to give you all a friendly reminder that the next month or so is NOTORIOUS for causing late periods due to all of the ""stress"" (even if it's happy stress) of the holidays and family gatherings.  Especially this year with the added stress of Covid and navigating having to turn down family functions, it is quite likely that you or someone you know will end up with an extra long menstrual cycle in the next few weeks.   


So, before you freak out that you might be pregnant, here's the science:

* Your period starts due to a decrease in the hormone **progesterone** that occurs 11-14 days after ovulation.
* Your period is not on a ""clock"" and doesn't know that it's been 28 or however many days since your last period.  All it knows is that it starts when progesterone levels fall off---whether that's on day 28 or day 55. 
* If your body is under stress, it will sometimes push back ovulation day later and later until things calm down enough.  Stress can = changed sleeping patterns, changed eating habits, working out more, working out less, being anxious about something, being overly busy, traveling, etc. etc. 
* As I said before, your period will NOT start until \~11-14 days AFTER ovulation. So if your body pushes ovulation back, it's gonna push your period back too.

So, if you aren't tracking ovulation (so you don't know if it's 11-14 days after), I wouldn't freak out if your period ends up a bit late this month or next month.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/k05ufw/psa_tis_the_season_for_late_periods/,PSA: Tis the Season for Late Periods,,160,27,0.99,Pleasant-Present

ixti0v,TwoXSupport,1600800203.0,"Picture this. You're in bed with a man. He finishes, settles down onto his pillow, and then, almost as an afterthought, asks: ""Did you...y'know...? 

The man cannot bring himself to say ""come"" or ""orgasm"" or ""climax."" Perhaps he doesn't even know what it looks like for a woman to do those things, based on this pathetic after-thought of a question that he asks so lazily, so hesitantly, so as to carefully imply that even if you were to say ""No,"" there's nothing that could possibly be done about it.  The man has come, so the sex is done.   


I can't be the only one who has experienced this time and time again. I'm very happy with my current partner, who makes sure that we both get off. He might make me come 3 times before he does. But I feel like a man who prioritizes women's pleasure is so goddamn rare, and it makes me really sad. I'm bisexual, and the difference between sex with men and women is so different. With women, you might make each other come for hours until you're both too tired & satisfied to continue. With a dude, he comes, the 15 minute sex is apparently over, & you're left horny and frustrated as hell.   


I guess my advice is: You deserve so much better than that! Never settle for a man who doesn't prioritize your pleasure at least as much as his own. Sex is for everyone, and pleasure is for everyone. And if your current dude thinks sex is over after he comes even if you're close yourself, teach him that that's not how things should work. You wouldn't stop the sex if the orgasms were the other way around. You can keep going, in other and more creative ways. You both deserve pleasure.

I have never posted anything on reddit despite lurking and reading on this subreddit for years, but i finally rid myself from this horrid infection and i had to hop on and share in case this works for anyone else. So, a little backstory, I (25F) have been struggling with chronic BV since i was 17, gardnerella vaginalis to be specific! For the first 2 years my doctor kept prescribing me antibiotics, which honestly never worked, caused yeast infections, and ruined my entire immune system. After being fed up with this around my early 20s, I decided to quit antibiotics and try a natural remedy route. At this point, tests were showing that gardnerella spread to even my cervix, which doctors said there was nothing more modern meds could for me anyway. 

 Ive been to every doctor, tried every supplement imaginable. Boric acid, baking soda, pre&probiotics garlic, yogurt, apple cider vinegar, wild oregano oil, lactic acid gel, douching after sex w peroxide, even suppositories made up of only lactobacili and nothing fucking worked!!!! I was so exhausted i just gave up, used boric acid before and after my period for 5 days each month to get rid of the horrid smell, and id been doing that since i was 22. Until 2 weeks ago. I had a pretty bad bv flare up after being sick w the flu that was making me so frustrated as i wanted to see my bf, but as you can imagine there was no way i was letting him get close to me while i smelled like rotten fish juice. I went on this subreddit once again, desperately looking for ANY new advice as id try anything. And i found a comment under a post saying this girl got cured in 3 days after years of bv by taking maca root powder! So, i immediately went to a pharmacy and picked some 3000mg maca root powder capsules by the brand Superfoods, and quit my usual routine w boric acid to see if it will work. Oh. My. God. In just 5 days everything was gone. Legit! AND ITS STAYED GONE! EVEN AFTER MY PERIOD! 

HOLY SHIT YOU GUYS GO BUY MACA ROOT POWDER, GIVE IT A TRY! Idk if this will work for everyone, and i did extensive research to find any link for maca root treating bv, found none. Even used my moms health officals  only site (membership requires a health worker license) to try to find anything but literally no doctor gave maca root for anything except libido and fertility. Idk how this works at all but i decided to post here since it may help women get rid of this awful infection and maybe spread awareness for maca root being used more as a supplement for this! If you do try please report back, im super curious to see if this will help women suffering as i did!

I agree that periods should be normalized because none of us should have to deal with being shamed for something we can't control. 

But as I was handwashing my bloody underwear today morning, I couldn't help but think ""what the actual fuck am I doing?""

If I was bleeding out of my ass I would be so concerned. If I was bleeding out of my nose I'd be concerned. If I was bleeding out of literally *any orifice* other than my vagina, I'd be concerned. But when I wake up and see a giant blood clot in my underwear I'm totally okay with it and just get right to business. 

In my opinion we should all just protest against periods and make a big hoot and cancel them once and for all in order to ensure that future generations don't have to suffer, and i don't care if it's medically impossible. 

I feel so violated and I'm not even joking. It's not even funny. Like I *know* that it's inevitable and a normal bodily function and all that but I didn't ask for this shit. Idk I'm just raging right now.

13im9wu,Healthyhooha,1684188616.0,"Hi All. Long time lurker, first time posting in this sub. 

When I (23F) was 15, I had a shitty boyfriend who wanted to fist me. I was a virgin and really didn‚Äôt know much about anything, so I said yes. I thought it was a normal request because I didn‚Äôt know any better.

So, he did. A few minutes in, we realized that the couch cushion we were sitting on was covered in blood. I stood up and blood was just POURING out of me. I freaked out, didn‚Äôt want my parents to find out, so we hurriedly cleaned everything up and I put a pad on while I continued to bleed. The next day, I was still bleeding and passed out at one point.

I didn‚Äôt want my parents to know, so I never said anything. but a few days later I noticed that my labia minora had been torn and was hanging almost completely off. 

I never went to the doctor for it, I‚Äôve still never seen a gynecologist, and my labia never healed. It‚Äôs still torn and hanging loose after almost 9 years. 

It usually doesn‚Äôt bother me during sex, but does get irritated occasionally during sex. Sometimes I won‚Äôt think about it for weeks and other times it really hurts. It‚Äôs embarrassing too as I think it looks ugly.

The boyfriend I had at 15 was an insecure jerk and had abusive tendencies. Getting away from him was the best thing I‚Äôve ever done for myself. It hurts me to feel like I let him permanently disfigure me. 

So I guess what I‚Äôm asking is‚Ä¶ is this a common injury to get from sex and I‚Äôm just being dramatic? Can it be fixed after all this time? Is there anything I can take or put on it to ease the occasional pain? I‚Äôve never talked to anyone about this and just wanted to get it off my chest and get advice.

lje5ou,Healthyhooha,1613265865.0,"Ladies, I am in shock.

In a nutshell, I got my first ever Yeast Infection (YI) back in November and have been battling reoccurring ones since then. I read Boric Acid helps fight both YI and Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) and, though I'm lucky to say (knock on wood) I haven't experienced BV, I decided to try the boric acid for 21 days.

FYI, I've used all the OTC creams and prescription creams available - YI always returns. I'm on a strict candida diet and have been eating a bunch of probiotics (refrigerated ones including RenewLife and Dr. Formulated) and anti-fungals (oregano oil, garlic, caprylic acid). Boric acid was my ""last resort"".

The boric acid was irritating at first, but eventually the irritation went away and so did the YI (I think), though I'd get random pings of itchiness here and here. That said, **I found my infection would come back days after I stopped using the boric acid.**

I'm from Canada, so our boric acid brands are limited, I bought the [NutraBlast Boric Life brand](https://www.amazon.ca/NutraBlast-Boric-Acid-Vaginal-Suppositories/dp/B07212DK9F/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3LH1FR4Y5OD79&dchild=1&keywords=boric+acid&qid=1613262772&sprefix=boric+a%2Caps%2C177&sr=8-5) because of their awesome reviews, this was the boric acid I used for 21 days before the YI would return.

So I thought it may be the brand, I then bought a different brand called Intimae, I'm shocked to see the **boric acid powder is** **different** than that of that of NutraBlast's.

I've attached pics, you can see how NutraBlast's is ""chunkier"" than that of Intimae. **More importantly** the capsule of NutraBlast has **glitter** in it that's released after it's melted - WTF?! When I read the 1 star Amazon reviews, lots of women stated it's not real boric acid, now I'm beginning to think the same thing.

I've yet to give Intimae a try, though I seriously wonder if the chunkiness and whatever glitter of NutraBlast's boric acid was causing my irritation and not getting rid of the YI.

Has anyone else had these problems with boric acid? Do you use NutraBlast's Boric Life?

Also, reading through, I've realized this sounds like some type of ad for Intimae - it's not, I seriously just want to put this post out there because I worry about the ingredients I was putting in my vagina for so long.

You know I keep it squeaky, yeah (You know I keep it squeaky)‚Äù

Cups are just so comfortable!! I have used tampons on a few occasions before, but a menstrual cup almost lifts a weight off my chest. I'm not adding to the landfills like I used to (won't be doing that for the next 30 years at the least), I do not have to feel uncomfortable in the groin wearing a pad next to my already sensitive and dry skin, and best of all, I save so much money!

It took me a few attempts to figure out how to use a mentrual cup and what fold to use to ensure that the cup opens properly, etc. I missed half an hour of college lecture doing that today. But dude, was it worth it!! I don't have to worry about leaks or stains and need not empty the cup for another 4 hours. One of the reasons I'd get irritated before this was that uncomfortable feeling wearing a pad and the anticipation of it. Since that is taken care of now, the only things that remain are practice pulling the cup out and dealing with the PMDD. 

It's a pity though, that I took so long to make the switch. I'm 21, have menstruated for 10 years and have known about this product for over 5 years now. I wish I'd done this earlier.

It‚Äôs been a very long time since having one and I have been very sick the last week not realizing my iron levels were tanked. I thought I was having mini strokes and was going to go to the hospital next week on Monday. I‚Äôve been damn near passing out/can‚Äôt see or stand at all when the episodes hit. I called my boyfriend of three years to explain that I am probably fine and that I got my period. I started to tell him about the iron levels being depleted from the blood and he shut me down immediately and said he doesn‚Äôt want to listen to any of that.

Now this is the issue: 
I freaked out and said we were never having children if he couldn‚Äôt handle talking to me about my literal well being as is related to my period, as I wasn‚Äôt even talking about the blood itself, just what was happening to me with the iron. He still couldn‚Äôt stomach it.

He got very mad that I said that about having his children and I feel like I can‚Äôt help him because I honestly believe what I said. Birth is very messy and I need serious support during and after birth and if this bothers him than idk what to tell him. I agree it‚Äôs gross but I can‚Äôt help it? It‚Äôs not my fault. I needed support yesterday too but thankfully I have a slew of really good friends who brought me iron pills and good food and stayed with me. This morning, I finally feel better!!

Hello, Hooha friends.

As we're sure many of you know by now, Roe v Wade was effectively overturned by the Supreme Court yesterday, returning regulation of abortions to the states.

Disclaimer: This is a specific US issue, and we acknowledge not everyone is from the US here.

This most definitely affects many of us here that are capable of becoming pregnant, and we wanted to show some solidarity and offer some credible resources and other subreddits that could offer guidance and assistance for those of us who find ourselves in need of abortion services. In the event you find yourself in need of hospital care after a home abortion, you do NOT have to tell them so. There is no reliable test to detect abortion medications in your bloodstream, and there's no medical way to distinguish a home abortion from a spontaneous miscarriage.

It's worth mentioning that we should all be cautious of the rhetoric we engage in here. Much of the discourse that draws parallels between, for example, The Handmaid's Tale and yesterday's ruling ignores the fact that BIPOC people have suffered from these injustices a lot longer than white women have. We strongly suggest that your social media feeds are diverse and include BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, and other marginalized/disenfranchised folks, as they are often the most impacted and have important views to consider as we navigate our way through this mess. It's also worth remembering that it isn't just men in power making these decisions - there is a large demographic of women who bear responsibility for this outcome as well.

Be safe. If you live in a state with trigger bans and/or states with strict regulations, consider long-acting reversible contraception, stocking up on condoms, ""reasonable"" stocking up on birth control pills or Plan B (reasonable meaning leave some for others), tubal ligations or vasectomies.

Vote in local and state elections to make your voice heard on those levels.

Please do NOT share folk or herbal ""remedies"" to induce abortion.

In solidarity,

About 4/5 months ago I started bleeding and tearing during sex. Nothing about our sex life changed, not the positions, the intensity, the lube, anything.

The tear seems to be right at the entrance to the vagina - almost like an excess piece of skin and it tears upon insertion every time. It bleeds a little bit but not much. It hurts once the penis is inserted but much less, like a deep ache kind of pain. But the pain at the tear is sharp and bad. 

I am super turned on, I actively want to have sex with my partner, I am consenting, never coerced and he never makes me feel bad for stopping sex because of the pain. 

I have seen my doctor many times and there‚Äôs no infection but inserting the speculum was so painful I cried - this has never happened before.

My doctor just prescribed some lube but it‚Äôs made no difference. She also suggested emptying my bladder and having a bath to relax before sex - doesn‚Äôt make a difference.

I now can‚Äôt have penetrative sex anymore and I want to. I am definitely turned on, my partner makes me orgasm 3 times before we try and thing penetrative but I am just in too much pain to do it.

Hi everyone! After 30 years of having a problem free vagina, I recently had my first two encounters with thrush. 

I ended up going down the rabbit hole of treatment, and found boric acid which worked so much better than I could have hoped. 

I have seen it popping up in this subreddit, and others, that people believe/are worried that boric acid will wipe out the bad AND good bacteria. 

Out of professional curiosity as a lab assistant in cytology, and after many hours of reading and talking to some amazing people who have done far more extensive research into the topic, I‚Äôve decided to run a little experiment to really see how boric acid affects lactobacilli. 

I took my first sample today, which is what has prompted my enthusiasm for the experiment, and was delighted to find a perfectly healthy looking flora with plenty of lactobacilli, no visible fungal spores, or other alarming bacteria (as confirmed by three cytologists). 

I‚Äôll attach a photo in the comments of all the little bacteria hanging out with the squamous cells on the slide. 

The further study I‚Äôm going to conduct will involve me and one of my friends (so far, hoping I can rope in more people!) and will involve the following samples:

- before boric acid use (at least one month without use)
- after 1 day, 2 days, and 3 days
- 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks (maybe a month) after last use without any probiotic use. 

I‚Äôm very excited to be able to contribute in some small way to such a fascinating topic, and hope I‚Äôll be able to bring some peace of mind to people suffering from recurrent thrush and BV that they won‚Äôt destroy their microbiome by using boric acid.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/1437cql/effect_of_boric_acid_on_lactobacillus/,Effect of boric acid on lactobacillus,,153,68,1.0,KathleenMayC

a4wcfu,Healthyhooha,1544453954.0,"I wanted to provide an update to [the post from two weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/9ztsix/i_just_pulled_a_condom_out_of_my_vagina_it_was_in/?st=JPIFER9Y&sh=e18d0904) where I was freaking out about having found a condom stuck inside of my vagina. I received a lot of a good advice and reassurance which did help put my mind at ease. 

There were two main things I was worried about: damage to my vagina and pregnancy. 

Regarding damage to my vagina: I was told to look out for signs and symptoms of BV, a yeast infection, or general irritation. I have very much been in tune with my hooha and haven‚Äôt noticed any changes. So thank you for the tips there. 

Regarding pregnancy: I had been worried that the first condom stuck inside of me potentially damaged the second condom. I was also reminded of precum. Somebody suggested I get Plan B. I talked to my boyfriend at the first opportunity (who was amazingly supportive and kind and not at all freaked out) and asked him if he had cum the night before. (I honestly didn‚Äôt remember because I was a little bit sloshed.) He said he hadn‚Äôt. I told him then and there that I had been contemplating the morning after pill, but that I was now opting not to get it because he didn‚Äôt come and I was right on the cusp of efficacy. (I fluctuate between 165 and 170lbs.) He was fine with my choices. 

My update comes to you today because I got my period! My painful, cramping, gassy, makes me feel like a demon period. Aunt Flo actually came into town about 3-4 days early, so I didn‚Äôt even have time to panic. 

This experience has inspired two changes in my life: Less sloppy, drunk sex (ergo less drinking in general) and lose some weight. I‚Äôve cut back on the IPAs, upped my intake in salads, and started kickboxing.

Thank you, r/Healthyhooha for the advice, reassurance, and support! You all definitely put my mind at ease.

kifnja,TwoXSupport,1608676009.0,"Hello everyone,

The mod team has decided to address the potential issues of a subreddit called FemaleDatingStrategy,  bleeding over into TwoXSupport. FDS is a subreddit who's goal, on the surface is about women getting the upper hand while dating men. While some of the posts there are on par with the values with TXS, there are some very sharp contrasts between us.

FDS believes marriage is a must in a relationship and speaks ill of women who do not wish to marry. Gender stereotypes are seemingly supported against men (Men MUST be the primary source of finances but women must not be the primary care givers to give a small example). This type of rhetoric is ultimately unhealthy. We certainly have our issues with men, hence the need for a subreddit like ours but we do not support gender stereotyping even when it's ""in our favour"". FDS has also gone so far as to take a negative of view of women who love their partners regardless of having flaws.

FDS is against sex work and workers on a fundamental level. While much of their reasoning seems based in logic and at times is aimed toward the NEED for sex work it ultimately detracts from supporting the women in it regardless of their circumstances and can be hostile toward those women.

I have yet to independently verify reports of rape victim brigading/bashing/blaming or transphobia though I have seen many comments against other cis women that lead me to believe the above is not only believable but likely. Other mods have however stated they have seen victim blaming for themselves and transphobia is alluded to in r/AgainstHateSubreddits due to mod overlap.

So while TXS is a women's subreddit, and can have the odd ""I hate men"" vent post, FDS takes this sentiment to a level that I would need an entirely separate post to adequately explain. TXS is about women being the best they can be, not the best they SHOULD be. An ideal to push yourself beyond your own imagined or imposed limitations in itself is not unhealthy but needs to be done with consideration that not all are capable or even willing to do so, and those who fit those descriptors should not be shunned.

In closing, we have decided to disallow promotion of FemaleDatingStrategy in posts or comments in TwoXSupport. Any posts or comments promoting FDS will be removed and continued breach of this policy will warrant further action upon review.

Thank you!

ikmyas,TwoXSupport,1598976026.0,"Today and yesterday, there have been two posts in both of these subs condemning violence against women, only to have a flood of men commenting and explaining why this is actually a non-issue.

I'm really, really sick of seeing this on reddit, and sometimes it makes me want to give up on the platform entirely. I don't know how you can deny all of the facts and statistics that point to the fact that we have an epidemic of male violence in the US and globally. Every time a shooter makes it onto the news, I never see male violence brought up as a framework through which to discuss it. [Of 93 shooters in 2014, 97 percent were male.](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/02/male-violence-is-everywhere/554261/) In the face of the BLM protests, I think about how female police officers [are far less likely to use force](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/06/18/women-police-officers-violence/) when apprehending suspects. In 2017,  a survey found that only 11 percent of female officers reported they had ever fired their weapon while on duty, compared with 30 percent of male officers.

I'm always taken aback by the number of men who think that the women pointing out these statistics just hate men, when we just want men to stop abusing women--and each other. And, we actually have common goals. I believe that male socialization is the root of this problem. Men are socialized to suppress their feelings and are taught that anger is one of the only acceptable outlets for their emotions. This is bad for everyone, and derailing the conversation by saying ""but men can also be victims of domestic abuse"" doesn't accomplish anything. We know that it's possible, but it's far less likely given the ways women vs men are socialized and raised.

The American Psychological Association has been doing wonderful work in trying to combat male violence by addressing the ways in which men are socialized: ""The possibility of negative effects of harmful masculinity occurs when negative masculine ideals are upheld. Primary gender role socialization aims to uphold patriarchal codes by requiring men to achieve dominant  and aggressive behaviors (Levant et al., 2003). The concept of gender roles is not cast as a biological phenomenon, but rather a psychological and socially constructed set of ideas that are malleable to change  (Levant & Wilmer, 2011)."" [Source](https://www.apa.org/pi/about/newsletter/2018/09/harmful-masculinity). But then, the APA was condemned by many right-leaning news outlets as ""[attacking masculinity](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/12/psychology-masculinity-men-apa-guidlines).""

I feel like as a whole, women are forbidden to point out male violence as a problem. But nothing will get better if we can't talk about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSupport/comments/ikmyas/posts_condemning_femicide_challenged_in_both/,Posts condemning femicide challenged in both /r/WorldNews and /r/TwoXChromosomes,Vent/Discussion Post ,148,16,0.98,onthemotorway

10kz36r,WomensHealth,1674654743.0,"I‚Äôm 28, I‚Äôve been on birth control since I was 16. Initially it was to regulate my periods and prevent pregnancy. In college, I developed a chronic illness with a lot of pain centering around my pelvic area and, being female, doctors prescribed birth control to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù with the pain (I went off it for a bit before that, not sure why honestly). It did seem to help with the pain on some level. 

That said, I‚Äôve always had a problem getting wet (self-lubricating? I don‚Äôt know the gentle term for this), which, when I was having sex with men, led to a lot of trauma we don‚Äôt need to get into. All of this combined with the birth control itself led to an almost nonexistent sex drive, which led to a lot of fights and sadness between my now-wife and I.

This month, I picked up my birth control late. I had already been off it for a week and my pain wasn‚Äôt any worse. I‚Äôve actually been on new pain meds for over a year, so I figured those would cover whatever pain control the birth control was doing. I decided not to take it, just to see how I felt.

So about three days ago, I (19f) noticed a foul odor coming from the bathroom. You know when you‚Äôre on a road trip and you pass by a large farm? Then you smell all the cow poop? That‚Äôs what it smelled like. I was confused but thought nothing of it. Then yesterday I went to go pee and I noticed the smell was coming directly from ME. I made sure to wipe myself thoroughly because I thought maybe my vagina was being weird (I‚Äôm supposed to start my period soon). Then when I went to pee again later that day that‚Äôs when I really noticed it wasn‚Äôt my vag itself but my actual urine. 

I thought maybe I was drinking something that made it smell that way (I‚Äôve only been reusing a SmartWater bottle and filling it with normal water for at least two days). Now today, I woke up with the feeling that I need to pee really badly. So I went to go pee and it felt itchy in one spot in my vagina. I peed and everything was normal but I sat on the toilet trying to make myself pee again. It felt like something was blocking me from peeing but a little bit of urine came out. I tried again 30 minutes later and then blood started to come out. It wasn‚Äôt a lot but it was enough to freak me out. 

I‚Äôm planning to get a physical and a Pap smear done soon for different reasons but I‚Äôm freaking out. Idk if I should tell my mom and go to urgent care but I‚Äôm scared. It doesn‚Äôt hurt, it just feels like a weird itchy sensation if I try to force myself to pee.

I did use a sex toy last week on the 23rd but I always make sure to thoroughly clean it whenever I use it. I‚Äôve never had sex with another person and I know for a fact I don‚Äôt have a yeast infection.

Update: I called my mom and she‚Äôs on her way. I‚Äôm crying and freaking out right now because I‚Äôm scared that this is now going to my kidneys

Update: I‚Äôm getting antibiotics now, thanks to everyone for urging me to go. Also to those asking why I didn‚Äôt go immediately, I have anxiety and I hate going to the doctors.

It started with waking up in the middle of the night to go pee, which I found really bothersome. Since it bothered me, I started to make an effort to pee before tucking myself in. Now, I have to do it several times before I‚Äôm satisfied. I feel the urge to pee but nothing comes out. 

And no, I do not think it‚Äôs a UTI because I do not have any problems peeing/feeling the urge to pee during the day. It‚Äôs only right before bed, and it‚Äôs worse when i am stressed. 

I met someone who said she had the same problem  and that her fear was peeing the bed. And she overcame it by just accepting the possibility of peeing herself.

 I told my  boyfriend about my experiences and he assured me it's okay and he won't touch me below if I don't want that.  I know it's such a weird thing since it's the easiest way to get off for most women lol.. 

anyway we are in a long distance relationship and don't have much beside phonesex or camsex. 
I stopped using penetrative toys(even tho I only ever came through them) as I feel it takes away the sensitivity when my bf and I have sex, so i started doing  something that never worked for me: flicking the bean. 
 fingering just feels like I'm violating myself so it never feels nice. it's really strange. I told my bf and he suggested that I use a toy if that helps. 

since I didn't have anything I wanted to use,  I looked into the satisfyer as my toy website was recommending it since I can remember. I never got it bc I thought it's a waste of money as clitoral stimulation felt uncomfortable to me.  well  but it was on sale so I grabbed one. 

Trying it on for the first time was SUPER uncomfortable,  I was so tensed I had to force myself to relax, got boyfriend on the call to calm me down and sweet lord jesus and holy mary that thing changed me.  

it's been a few weeks and I'm not 100% relaxed while using it but I feel like it really helped getting used to clitoral stimulation. the orgasms are out of this world. I tried fingering and even that's better than before.  I'm sure there is some deep psychological reason for all that but all I can say is that in those 9 years of being sexually active, I've never felt this good on my own, I feel like I have rediscovered masturbating lol

But most importantly thank you for making me feel understood and valid for the way I‚Äôm feeling & allowing me to understand that I‚Äôm doing what‚Äôs best for me. That‚Äôs the biggest take away I‚Äôve received.

I wanted to provide a small update. I decided to terminate the pregnancy. After going to planned parenthood today it was confirmed that I‚Äôm 5 weeks pregnant. While speaking to my doctor I told her my concerns about work and not wanting to miss. I didn‚Äôt want to take the pills today or tomorrow but honestly had no choice, which I 100% understood. 

The doctor was so wonderful, the amount of calmness and reassurance she gave me was unbelievable. She was so great and I am so thankful to have had her to guide me through this process. She gave me a doctors note and provided me with different ways to tell my work why I won‚Äôt be showing up. Which I greatly appreciated.

Emotionally I‚Äôm a mess, I know this is the right decision for me and my significant other but it‚Äôs still so hard. I was able to see the baby and that made it real and honestly that‚Äôs when I completely lost it. 

My brother, boyfriend, and best friend have been my rock. I don‚Äôt know what I would do without them and their support.

I am so nervous for the pills I‚Äôm taking tomorrow. I‚Äôve heard they are terrible and is the worst experience. If anyone has gone through this and would like to share their experience please message me I would greatly appreciate it.

I recently discovered 2 lumps on my  Cervix, one is very small like a pinhead, the other is larger, like a ball bearing. Both are smooth, solid, non-painful and non-oozy (sorry that's ever so gross a way to put it). 

I've had lots of problems with endometriosis and am a good advocate for my health and well being in general... so off I popped to the doctor, I described what I had found, he looked at me like I was insane... then said, ""the cervix is very high up you know, are you sure you were feeling that? "" 

I said, ""yes, of course, I know what's normal with my body, can you please perform an exam and let me know if I should be concerned.""  I feel I was straightforward if a little bit curt, but not rude and not demanding... 

He then said "" well I can't even perform pelvic exams as I've not kept up with training and am no longer allowed"" he then leaned towards me and said in utter disbelief ""women can't usually feel their cervix.. What WERE you doing up THERE"" (capital letters for his raised eyebrows)

I asked if there was anyone else who could perform an exam and he told me the nurse, but I can't get an appointment until March... tbh I really want to leave the GP practice after that experience, I felt really uncomfortable, it was deeply inappropriate and undermining to my concerns...

I still need to get it checked out, all things on the internet point to it being a harmless nabothian cyst but does anyone here think I should be more worried??

A few weeks (months?) ago a video went kinda viral on reddit of a guy that helps his girlfriend during her period. She‚Äôs filmed laying in bed and suffering like crazy. I feel bad - no, we probably all feel bad for her - because we know how this feels. Her boyfriend goes to the grocery store and buys her all kind of food and drinks and puts on a movie for her while she snuggles on the couch.

Well, this is actually great, he cares for her and makes sure she‚Äôs comfortable during her excruciating pain. But why, WHY, does this need to be filmed? People were praising the guy as if he cured cancer, while in my opinion taking care of your sick partner is the bare minimum. He‚Äôs sweet for doing this, but why do you need validation from people? This is not about you dude and if you have to film getting your girlfriend chocolate because how else would people know you don‚Äôt invalidate your partners pain your missing the point IMO.  

I know there are a lot of guys who do this without feeling the need to be treated like the founder of empathy, so I‚Äôm absolutely not saying this is typically a man‚Äôs thing to do, but I get so tired of people jerking off over the fact they were nice to their suffering girlfriend.

I mention the age gap just to give insight into the power dynamic of the relationship as well as the gap in sexual experience. I was a virgin, no one had so much as seen my vagina, and this guy had had sex a substantial number of times. A lot was wrong with the relationship, but the break up was incredibly bad and it culminated in him insulting me physically. He told me that he had found me disgusting and that my vagina was gross and smelled bad. This was the first person I had ever loved, and our relationship was very codependent, so the sudden break up and insults were very traumatic for me. 

It‚Äôs been 3 years since all this has happened, and I‚Äôve gained a lot of insight in terms of vaginal health as well as how toxic that relationship was. He was a grown man dating a minor in high school, which is what was really disgusting, and now I‚Äôm educated on all the nuances of vaginal smells. I know logically that my vagina is healthy, however, I just can‚Äôt get rid of the feeling that my vagina is disgusting, and in turn of that, I as a person am disgusting. It‚Äôs really affected my relationship with my vagina, and although I‚Äôve made some progress, I seem to have this underlying fear that my vagina is going to cause potential partners to leave me once they‚Äôve had sex with me. My last ex-boyfriend (not the one previously described) sort of distanced himself about 3 months into the relationship, and although I knew it was because we didn‚Äôt really have that great of a connection, I can‚Äôt help but feel that my vagina is what drove him away.

My current boyfriend is pretty amazing in regards to boundaries and sex, and I actually feel comfortable with him going down on me, but whenever he‚Äôs eating me out I can‚Äôt fully focus because there‚Äôs that nagging insecurity at the back of mind. It really sucks that I can‚Äôt seem to get over this because I feel like it‚Äôs such a big obstacle in terms of me actually enjoying sex, and I just want to see my vagina in a positive light.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm tough enough for the internet or reddit, the sexism of it all is chipping away at me when all I want is to raise awareness. Last time I posted about this on 2X (kinda decided fuck it, I‚Äôm leaving reddit anyway so I‚Äôll post a rant) I got a lot of support and validation and it meant a lot that all these women understood. Thought I‚Äôd stick around a little longer.

But today I just feel defeated. Why can‚Äôt we talk about women‚Äôs issues without men shutting us down?

The amount of UTIs, yeast infections, BV, etc that I‚Äôve dealt with in the last year...really makes you think about how women used to just deal with it. I also just don‚Äôt understand how these things go away on their own. A few times I‚Äôve tried to wait out infections and it‚Äôs like they do not get better without medication...this stuff is bad enough with medication to provide some semblance of relief.

Also a rant because I‚Äôm just so frustrated with my body. Since taking the last round of antibiotics for a recurrent UTI I seem to have developed quite the yeast infection.

15rjqcn,Healthyhooha,1692078585.0,"Hello.  I‚Äôm a 21-year-old autistic woman.  Last week I went to the gynecologist to get my first check up where the doctor checked my breasts, did cervical cancer testing, and STD testing.  I was positive that all my results would come back negative because I‚Äôm a virgin.  The only reason why I did the check up was because my primary care doctor recommended that I should and she said that I was due for cervical cancer screening.  I‚Äôve never had a boyfriend or sexual contact of any kind with anyone.  I‚Äôve never even kissed anyone.

To my shock, today I got my results back.  I tested positive for Gonorrhea.  Everything else came back negative.  At first I thought that this must‚Äôve been a mistake because I‚Äôm a virgin and I have no symptoms associated with it.  How could it be possible for me to have an STD?  But the lady who told me about my results said that the test that the doctor gave me is usually accurate and that she wants to immediately put me on medication.  She also said that people who have it can be asymptomatic.

I feel dirty, impure, and disgusted with myself.  Even though I know for sure that I‚Äôm a virgin, the idea of possibly having an STD disgusts me so much.  Not only that, there‚Äôs a lot of stigma associated with STDs.  I don‚Äôt want my family to turn on me and think I‚Äôm a ‚Äúwh*re‚Äù.  I know that innocent people who try to be responsible can still get STDs, but the stigma still lingers on my mind.  I don‚Äôt want people to think I‚Äôm a liar when I say that I‚Äôm a virgin.  I am a virgin and it‚Äôs the truth.  That diagnosis is like a stain on my reputation as a virgin.  One of the main reasons why I want to wait until marriage to lose my virginity is to avoid catching STDs.  Another reason is that it just makes me feel a sense of pride.

I‚Äôm also scared because now I‚Äôm wondering how I could‚Äôve gotten it and how there could be something I don‚Äôt know about that might‚Äôve caused my test to come back positive.

Now I‚Äôm wondering how I even got it.  I‚Äôve used tampons before, and I‚Äôve put my fingers inside my vagina to pull out discharge (when I‚Äôm ovulating) or period blood (when I‚Äôm on my period), but I always wash my hands before doing so.  I‚Äôve never used sex toys.  I‚Äôve hugged friends before, but that‚Äôs the closest I‚Äôve gotten in terms of physical contact with people.  I don‚Äôt always use toilet seat covers in public restrooms if it looks clean.  I got a vaccine (for HIV I think) in July that wouldn‚Äôt need to be boosted for another 10 years.  I‚Äôve never gone to parties or stayed at anyone‚Äôs house in the last 10 years, as I‚Äôm an introvert.  I have eczema on my vulva, armpits, and the back of my knees; I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs relevant since I didn‚Äôt see eczema listed as a symptom for Gonorrhea.

Can anyone tell me how I could‚Äôve gotten Gonorrhea while still being a virgin?

Also, is there any test that can be done to prove my virginity?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/15rjqcn/im_a_virgin_and_i_just_tested_positive_for/,I‚Äôm a virgin and I just tested positive for Gonorrhea.

Unfortunately a side effect of stem cell transplants is graft versus host disease (GVHD). Ive started showing signs in my mouth and wrists, I.E. Skin tightening, white patches, burning sensations. Overall its mild and treatable.
My oncologist talked to me about seeing a gynocologist-oncologist due to potentially having GVHD in my genitals. Ths gyno-onc i first saw did NOT listen to me at all. The reason I was reccomended was debilitating pain in my genitals. He never mentioned my cancer, my transplant, GVHD, or pain!! He just kept talking over me and didnt even listen. Thankfully he prescribed me estrogen and progesterone. He never really told me why, I had to google to find out it could help w the pain.

I told my oncologist about the visit and she was so mad. He didnt care about my pain at all!! She reccomended a NEW gyno who had worked with other women affected by GVHD, thank god.

I saw her a month later and she was AMAZING!! She listened, sympathized, and new a lot about my history (it seems she did the bare minimum of READING MY CHART!! Unlike a certain gyno...). She prescribed two different topical creams which will get rid of the pain!! After the appointment i cried, for a good reason this time. I just feel heard and seen amd listened to.

She also changed my estrogen and progesterone. Since I have a certain brand of IUD it gives me enough progesterone, so im off that pill now. And the estrogen dose I was on was too low for my age.

Just the 'basic' ones to get a general idea of what is going on. We could see fluctuations, and actively predict infections.   
We could know if it was a yeast infection, BV or something else. Could give the pH level also or whatever relevant information to give an accurate result - or be able to send the results to a professional for diagnosis. 

Why hasn't this been done before? Is it too expensive to to make such a product? Or maybe its not possible to test for cultures in an 'at-home' setting?

I have been seeing this doctor since I was younger because I went on birth control in high school. I have never had a Pap smear, just a pelvic exam so I was very nervous for my appointment today. My appointment was at 11:15 but I did not get called back to the room until about 12:15. The nurse came in and asked me questions and told me to get undressed. I asked her to tell my doctor that I have a lot of anxiety right now because I am a senior in nursing school and have a lot on my plate. The nurse left the room and I sat naked for about ten minutes before my doctor comes in accompanied by a student nurse practitioner who goes to my school. My doctor then proceeds to TELL me that the student is going to sit in for my exam. My doctor didn‚Äôt even do a pap, just a pelvic and she let the student ( who I go to school with) watch. I was so uncomfortable and embarrassed. She then scheduled for me to have a Pap smear in 6 months which is what I came in for today and I was charged 40$ for the copay.

bki16j,Healthyhooha,1556948669.0,"Hey folks,

I see recommendations for bidets here and they can be a great solution for improved hygiene and, when used carefully, may be helpful at reducing UTIs.

But that comes with one big caveat which I haven't seen discussed yet and it comes in the form of a very common bacterium named 'Serratia marcescens'.

**What is S. marcescens?**

[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serratia_marcescens) is: (abridged, my emphasis, from here on ""SM"")

> a species of rod-shaped, Gram-negative bacteria classified as an opportunistic pathogen. SM is commonly involved in hospital-acquired infections, particularly catheter-associated bacteremia, **urinary tract infections**, and wound infections. It is commonly found in the respiratory and **urinary tracts** of hospitalized adults and in the gastrointestinal systems of children. Due to its abundant presence in the environment, and its preference for damp conditions, **SM is commonly found growing in bathrooms (especially on tile grout, shower corners, toilet water lines, and basins), where it manifests as a pink, pink-orange, or orange discoloration and slimy film** feeding off phosphorus-containing materials or fatty substances such as soap and shampoo residue.

Have you ever seen any of those bathrooms where a bright pink/bright orange or rusty orange film has accumulated? Sometimes appearing in the bottom of sinks or especially at the bottom of unclean shower curtains?

That's almost certainly our good friend, SM. You might have seen it in ice makers or water dispenser lines too.

SM is much more likely to accumulate on unclean surfaces which are damp or constantly wet, and where there is hard water or nutrients to feed on. It can be stubborn to clean as it forms a film, so simply rinsing or spraying with a cleaning solution and giving it a gentle wipe is not likely to be sufficient to remove SM. Even if you remove all visible traces of SM with wiping, it's likely that small amounts of it will be left behind ready to recolonize as soon as they can.


...I bet that you know where I'm going with this.

**Your bidet may be a reservoir for SM bacteria, which may be introducing them into your urinary tract.**

So, what do?

* Check for the characteristic bright or ruddy orange/pink color of the SM biofilm, especially around holes or rims and edges of your bidet.

* If you find it, give the film a good scrub with a stiff brush and a mix of a little soap and some baking soda, ensuring to scrub all surfaces, holes etc. thoroughly

* Sterilize the bidet using a bleach solution or other disinfectant, following instructions for sterilization of plastic object. (**Being extremely careful not to mix bleach or other sterilizing solutions with cleaning products!!**)

* Rinse well

* Use as normal

And remember to always clean your bidet when you clean your toilet!

&nbsp;

This isn't likely to be the #1 source of UTIs but if you're sensitive to them or you are struggling with them despite doing everything right, it might be that you're unintentionally exposing yourself to SM without realizing it when you use a bidet.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/bki16j/im_spraying_what_where_serratia_marcescens_a/,I'm spraying *what* *where*!? | Serratia marcescens: a cautionary tale for bidet-users,,142,11,0.98,Randolf_Schnitzler

I know a lot of women get UTIs after sex and I was one of them. It got worse and worse until literally every time I had sex I would get one even if we both showered/cleaned beforehand and I peed, used D-mannose, even used a bidet after. 

So I caved and went to a good urologist. I was hesitant because my experience with doctors has not been good, I end up spending time and money and nothing changes. But I am happy to report that is not the case. Because antibiotics often give me yeast infections, he put me on a medication called methenamine hippurate that acidifies your urine and I guess prevents bacteria from growing. I have not had a UTI since!! I don‚Äôt even have to immediately pee or use d-mannose and it is life changing. 

The doctor said he wants to see me UTI free for six months before taking me off the meds and that should hopefully be long enough for my body to reset it‚Äôs natural defenses.

A male colleague at work today told me to ""cheer up! It's not that bad!"" Because I wasn't walking around with a beaming smile on my face. This is the inspiration of my rage filled rant that I'm about to go on.

Want to know why I'm unhappy and why I'm not smiling? 


It feels like my insides are being twisted and tugged as well as being punched and ripped apart. And it's not only my insides that feel like that - my vagina feels like it is being pulled open and something too big is trying to get inside it.

My entire body is having spasms and aches and the stabbing pain in my back is so bad I can't exist comfortably and everything I do is making me cripple over in pain. My thighs, calves and hips ache and hurt so walking is now a conscious effort that it shouldn't be.

The bloating. This isn't just a bloated feeling. No. You physically expand and blost. Your trousers now cut into your stomach and waist leaving dents on your body and your bra feels like it is made of razors. When you undress at the end of the day the marks left all over your body look like you've been in a war. 

Accompanying the bloat is the nausea. The constant feeling of am I going to be sick and having no appetite BUT I also want to eat everything bad for me. Yes, including that food I explicitly hate. I want it. 

Your breasts become so sore and tender that even wearing a fitted coat feels painful on your chest. Also lying down in bed is no longer comfortable because where are your boobs meant to go now? They hurt no matter what they're doing.

I constantly need the toilet, but what do I need? Who knows! What was that cramp? Was it me peeing? Was it me having an accident? Did I leak blood? All of the above? I feel like I have taken 100 laxatives and they're working their way through my body all the time.

The toilets at work are also great. Let's try and find a comfortable way to take out and put in a tampon or menstrual cup or change a pad in a tiny cubicle where there might be other people around. Also do I smell? Is anyone else smelling me or am I good...?

And no, I can't smile for you because my skin is so dry that stretching my lips into something resembling a smile will make them crack and bleed, as well as the rest of my face somehow being so dry it is peeling but also producing spots at an alarming rate. 

Your insecurities are at an all time high and you hate yourself so much you can't bear anyone to look at you. You don't even want to look at yourself because for these 7 days especially, you hate what you see in the mirror. 

Following on from this are the mood swings. Whatever you say to me might make me cry, angry, insecure etc.

1bbg8xi,WomensHealth,1710092876.0,"IUDs DON'T HAVE TO HURT!! DEMAND PAIN MANAGEMENT FROM YOUR OBGYN.

IUDs can be a fabulous solution to all of your birth control needs (though, like any medical procedure or medication, they don't work for everyone). They can be quick and painless to be placed and give you up to 10 years of protection depending on which device you choose.

If/when you get your first IUD or when you get an IUD removed or replaced, talk to your provider when you book your appointment (many times, speaking directly with the provider is necessary) about how you expect to be treated (like a human who can feel pain) and confirm that they will have lidocaine gel available to apply to your cervix at the very beginning of the appointment followed by a paracervical block injection before insertion or removal/replacement is attempted. I recommend calling the day before your appointment to confirm these details and also considering confirming this plan before putting your feet in the stirrups to ensure everyone is on the same page.

Louder for those in the back: IUDs DON'T HAVE TO HURT!! DEMAND PAIN MANAGEMENT FROM YOUR OBGYN.

On January first, I started having what looked like discharge, but it was nearly black. It lasted for three days and then it was over. It didn‚Äôt look like a period, I expected it to be more of a lighter color. Fast forward to today, and it is happening again. It is more of a brownish color, and is very gooey (much like discharge). I tried to google it, but nothing really told me an answer, so this is my next best option. A couple days before, I did have a sore lower back and bloating, and also abnormally thick discharge, but I just nudged it off.

kvuegw,Healthyhooha,1610467346.0,"I just want to scream. Since Sept, sex has been painful and bloody. I‚Äôve seen 5 diff doctors (I‚Äôm not even 21 yet so getting Pap smears from 5 strangers in a condensed period of time has been nothing short of stressful and anxiety-provoking), had a UTI, yeast infection, and BV (all I think stemming from hot tub sex). Anyway none of the treatments improved my sensitive and raw hooha... so finally I find out on my very own that there‚Äôs a tear in my coochie. Go back to doctor, show her and she can barely find it herself. Orders no sex for ten days, desitin application daily, and sitz or epsom baths. Did that for thirteen days, nothing heals. I go back, and now her theory is that being on hormonal birth control for five years has seriously weakened my vaginal tissue (a rare but possible problem, even more rare that it‚Äôs causing tearing and not just pain). When she simply put the friggin speculum in it caused a tear & bleeding. 

So my vagina is all weak and fragile. So she suggested I stop taking my hormonal birth control and start using a hormone cream daily for a month (no sex for a whole month either). AND to top it off she said I tested positive for bacterial vaginosis AGAIN even though I just fucking treated it so now I am having to take my fourth round of antibiotics in the past five months. 

I‚Äôm so flustered and I‚Äôm sad that I got the short end of the stick in terms of the unspoken side effects of birth control.

i3u2zm,TwoXSupport,1596582852.0,"In Hannah Gadsby's Netflix special Nanette (which I think is a must-watch for literally everyone), she describes how, by presenting in a traditionally ""masculine"" way, she is considered by many to be ""incorrectly female."" On top of the obvious hatred coming her way from straight people, this has also been an issue with the queer community as well. She goes on to say how she was confronted and told that she ""owes it to her community to come out as transgender."" Well, the thing is, she's not transgender. She's a woman who is, apparently, existing incorrectly.

I'm just so tired of people thinking that there is only one way to be a woman: adhering to traditionally ""feminine"" stereotypes. And then assuming that if you don't feel kinship with those sexist stereotypes, you must not be a woman.

I would describe myself as gender-non-conforming in presentation, since I wear my hair short, I don't shave, and my wardrobe is majority menswear. I feel deeply uncomfortable in dresses and makeup. I was held up at the airport by TSA because they thought I was a man, and my scan came up wrong. However, I feel comfortable in my own body (most of the time, anyway), and comfortable being a woman in my own way. But I don't know if I like the word ""cis"" to describe myself, since I don't want it to be assumed that I'm comfortable with our strict definition of woman. *That* definition is what makes me uncomfortable. Wearing dresses causes me dysphoria, but I feel damn good as a woman-identifying-female in a suit.

Pre-covid, I had an experience that really bothered me, wherein I was interacting with a group of women who started using ""they/them"" pronouns to reference me without asking me what I'd prefer. Now, I'm not offended by that, since I believe that they meant well. But I'm sad that we're at a point in our cultural dialog where if a woman doesn't look how we think she should look, then we conclude that she must not be a woman. That just seems deeply un-feminist to me. I wish that we could avoid assumptions about people's gender identities. I wish that we could understand that not conforming to traditional notions of the gender assigned to you doesn't mean that you're not that gender. Instead, I want us to expand the notion of what that gender--and more specifically, what womanhood--can look like.

EDIT: Edit to clarify that I don't take issue with the word ""cis"" as a whole; I just was musing about whether or not I felt that it accurately describes me since I have complex feelings about my relationship to my own gender.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSupport/comments/i3u2zm/on_hannah_gadsby_gender_and_being_incorrectly/,"On Hannah Gadsby, gender, and being ""incorrectly female""",Vent/Discussion Post ,141,17,0.97,onthemotorway

I then tried drinking 64 oz water/day and using the GCL vaginal hydrating gel (in the white bottle, specifically for hydration although the cheaper green one might work as well) and my discharge is now normal and has been for several days. I thought it was the acidic blood during my period that was getting rid of the thick white discharge, but now looking back it must have just been the hydration my vagina was getting during my time of month. 

Before my treatment, pH testing strips (when not on period) tested my vagina to a level of ~8/9 (so super alkaline) so I‚Äôm guessing the extra hydration is bringing me down more to an acidic level, since the thick white discharge is gone. I realize the solution sounds very simple but even when I thought I was drinking more water during the day, I was still not hitting my recommended daily water intake. 

Also, I have used the GCL vaginal gel when not drinking enough water, and it does not get rid of the discharge. So hitting your recommended daily water intake really is key here. 


TLDR-hydration may affect your vaginal pH, causing some issues down there.

j8dblq,WomensHealth,1602300228.0,"Holy cow...so...I am the girl who went from worrying whether her ovary is dead or not to battling ovarian cancer. Well, I am here with an update on something I expected to be much more minor than it was.

I got a PET scan before my chemo, and the ones who did it seemed concerned about one of my lungs...they said there was a bit of fluid in it. I must admit, I didn't think much of it due to the couple of weeks I was holding back coughing due to recovering from surgery, as well as the sinus troubles I was having. Thing is...when I went in for chemo, my doctor said it was concerning enough that she referred me for a possible lung draining. That appointment was today. I had no idea how serious the situation actually was.

For those who do not know what lung draining is, they basically numb you up, slide a needle into your affected lung cavity, replace the needle with a catheter, and drain the fluid. It is not comfortable, and in all honesty it was terrifying to me. However, if all goes smoothly the process is surprisingly short, and you are out of the hospital same-day. Yes, the needle hurts, and while they definitely can numb you, there is no numbing agent that can keep you from feeling that needle. I had to have a friend keep a vice-grip on my head until it went in and was replaced by the catheter.

By the time it was finished, they took 2 liters from my right lung. I...I had no words outside of the coughing. That was in me. I don't even know how I held that much. They said my lung was like a tiny little sponge because of it. I thought this trouble breathing was due to my recovering diaphragm. Nope, apparently I have been building this liquid since I was out of surgery, and I have been functioning on pretty much a single lung. I went into anaphylactic shock the other day with one working lung.

I have been through varying stages of mental freak-outs trying to figure out how this whole thing works.

Thankfully, the doctors and nurses are expecting my other lung to grow back to normal over the next couple of days now that it has the room. How, I don't know. I am just really, really glad they are so confident of that. Now I am sitting here in bed, breathing deeply and listening to my creaky little lung as it slowly takes back to breathing, and coaxing it to take in as much as it can...all the while grateful that I have never been a smoker. These little guys are strong...

So, hopefully, that should tie up any more surprises for now. I will try to add a picture that my friend took of one of the bottles when I figure out how to.

Eventually after trying to look down there to figure out why I couldn‚Äôt take out a tampon regularly, I saw some kind of thin tissue piece that was holding onto my tampon (real pleasant). 

It wasn‚Äôt until last night that I looked up why I may not be able to take out my tampon so easily. 

Hymen abnormalities. I have NEVER heard of this. It was only through some researching that I discovered that this could be my reason. 

While I haven‚Äôt seen a doctor for this, I believe I may have a septate hymen. Now, I just have to do some maneuvering to use tampons, but I am so glad I‚Äôve learned some more about the female body.

Cramps from walking too much and standing too long. Can't sit up straight while on my period because of the pain, so I hunch over with a heating pad. Weird discharge like I've never seen.

I told 4 different obgyns all of this over the last couple years and everytime they give me a pap and say my strings look great and my tests are all normal.

I‚Äôm sorry.  

Like ma‚Äôam. I‚Äôm sorry about your situation because if you want to be a mother and can‚Äôt or struggle or like her have to use ivf that‚Äôs unfortunate but how can you sit there and benefit from reproductive science? medical procedures? And then be unsympathetic to other forms of it?

I honestly don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any woman that‚Äôs just like OMG YES IM READY TO ABORT THIS BABY with like this lustrous thirst ppl are acting like they do. I‚Äôve never been in the position where I‚Äôd need an abortion but I can only imagine it‚Äôs not a decision someone would take lightly. 

But what I asked her is what would she do if they started regulating ivf? Since the government loves regulating or bodies? She didn‚Äôt reply to me..

I didn‚Äôt wanna be hurtful so I didn‚Äôt say this but I‚Äôve seen ppl make a religious point to it. That it‚Äôs God‚Äôs will for someone to be pregnant. Well ok then, how would she feel if someone told her it was God‚Äôs will she couldn‚Äôt get pregnant?

I wish I could‚Äôve got in sooner tbh because I‚Äôm scared now that option will be taken away from me. I‚Äôve been trying to convince my dr since my daughter was born 5yrs ago to do it. 

Now I‚Äôve finally got my foot in the door I don‚Äôt want it slammed in my face. I‚Äôm honestly scared they‚Äôll start messing with birth control. We‚Äôre one and done.

vjgp58,WomensHealth,1656047799.0,"I just had the absolute worst experience with a doctor I have ever had, and that's saying something.

I don't have insurance so everything is out of pocket and expensive AF.  I don't go unless I am absolutely sure I have to.  It has been probably 7 years since I have gone to the doctor. (Been in the ER a couple of times but that's different) Fortunately, I am pretty healthy and I want to stay that way.

And this is where it all goes wrong.

I'm 47 and I am one of the Big Girls.  Back in December, I decided to change that.  I have lost 100 pounds which puts me just under half of my weight loss goal.  I'm eating healthy and exercising...a LOT.  My goal is not weight loss, but to live a healthy life and that means rewriting 40+ years of bad habits. I have gone from barely being able to stand long enough to play Beat Saber to walking several miles a day.  I am proud of myself.  This is the hardest thing I have EVER done. 

Today I went to the doctor for three reasons.  No, I hadn't seen this doctor before so I had to do the full physical work-up and at the time I thought was worth it.   1. I need a new prescription for an EpiPen because I am allergic to bees (Confirmed anaphylaxis if I am stung) and my neighbor has several hives.  2.  My allergies are out of control and nothing seems to help.  3. Have a CBC run just to be sure nothing is out of whack...it's been 7 years! (Blood was drawn several days ago, I was getting the results today)

I left in tears, without the scripts I needed, two scripts I didn't need, and minus $275. 

The things he said to me included...

\~\~\~

""I just have trouble believing you have lost all that weight""  so I showed him my FitBit with all my recorded workouts and the app to my scale that shows my weight loss week by week.  ""Well, it's pretty easy to fake those things.""

\~\~\~

HIM: ""How much alcohol do you drink?""

Me: ""Very rarely.  It's been at least a year.""

HIM:  ""So you are in recovery? You shouldn't drink at all if you are.""

ME: ""Where did you get that idea?  I just don't really like it, I don't see the point of it.""

HIM: ""What about illegal drugs?""

ME: ""None.  And not ever.""  

HIM:  ""Are you sure?""

ME:  ""I think I would know if I was using drugs""

HIM: ""I'll have \*nurses name\* send some literature home with you about addiction.""

\~\~\~

""I have no doubt you are diabetic.  It's a given with people your size.""  My A1C is 4.6 and yes he had the lab results in front of him. 

\~\~\~

""You really should consider weight loss surgery because you will gain it all back if you don't.""

\~\~\~

HIM ""Have you considered seeing a therapist?""  in response to me asking for a prescription for an EpiPen.  

ME: ""Not unless the therapist is going to bring me an EpiPen""

HIM:  ""I don't like your attitude""

\~\~\~

And my personal favorite...

HIM: ""I'm not writing you a prescription for narcotics.""

ME:  ""WHAT THE HELL?  I didn't ask for any!""

HIM: ""You came in with a laundry list of medical problems.  It was just a matter of time before you asked for something.""

\~\~\~

It has been 12 hours and I am still just absolutely stunned. I don't even know how to process this.  He continually talked over me and interrupted me.  He ignored direct questions and twisted my answers no matter what I said.  He outright called me a liar twice and kept asking about my depression.  I hadn't said a single word about depression but he brought it up at least 3 times. The ironic thing is I actually have a degree in medical anthropology. I have been a patient advocate and have even helped clinics establish protocols for this exact situation.  

He wrote me a script for diabetes (Glucophage) and high blood pressure (lisinopril) but my blood pressure was low normal. I don't have high blood pressure, never have. His nurse handed me a packet with all kinds of pamphlets ranging from how to quit smoking (I don't smoke) to addiction to weight loss.  There was a list of therapists and bariatric clinics and a photocopied booklet called ""Inspiring Scriptures and Prayers"".

And no, this is not a free clinic.  I paid full freight for this after this jerk came highly recommended by several friends.  Ironically they are all very slender women. 

I was nothing but a number on a scale.  

I have never felt more invisible or more alone in my life. 

I don't even know if this will stay up. I don't know if this is the right place or if there is a better place but I needed to vent this before it made me cry again.  The friends who recommended him are saying that I am being overly sensitive and that he was just trying to help me, so there is untold drama on my FB page. The battle lines are being drawn between the people who believe me and the people who think I am seeking attention.  

The only thing I know for sure is that I am looking for another doctor and that it will probably be another 7 years before I go again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/vjgp58/see_you_in_seven_years/,See You In Seven Years...,Rant,135,50,0.99,BeatMeSaber

&#x200B;

As of last week, I've finally tested negative for BV. I've had BV for about 2 years but let me preface that I had no idea I had it / started to treat it until **May** of this year.

The reason  I didn't know I had it was because I thought all of the symptoms were normal (itching, red a bit swollen, a lot of discharge, yellow in color, the smell was never that bad so I guess that's why I didn't go to a gyno. I attributed it all to hormonal change and estrogen.

I've tested negative last week, and I don't want to say I've been cured yet because I am currently on my period and I want to see what happens after. I will make an update.

I want to also say that since **May** I've tried many many things to get rid of this, so I genuinely don't know what helped me to finally test negative. So I will break everything I since then until now.

It wasn't until this past March that my discharge turned from yellow to bright green. That's when I freaked out and googled, and it brought me to this thread and learned about BV and realized I had it all this time.

*I also haven't been sexually active for about a year and a half.*

So here's my timeline:

**May 14th - June 20th:** I started doing NutraBlast Boric Acid Vaginal Suppositories (1 week) and Rephresh Pro-B Probiotics (whole 30 days)

*Sometime around this time, I got my period but I did see a change in the amount of discharge and smell, and the itching was kinda gone. The green color was still prominent and I was still a bit red and swollen.*

**June 22nd:** Gyno appt. Got a pap and was prescribed drum roll, please... METRONIDAZOLE. She also gave me a refill because it might come back. So I did the round of metro plus boric acid for 7 days.  I had finished my probiotics last month so I didn't continue these.

I CHANGED ALL OF MY UNDERWEAR ALL OF THEM,

**June 24th - July 23rd:**  I was clear from all symptoms. I didn't get tested so I have no idea if it really went away around this time.

**July 24th- August 3rd:** A couple of days before my period I started to get the symptoms again. This time it wasn't the large amounts of discharge or smell, but just swollen and red, and itchy, watery discharge.

So I bought **Rephresh Pro-B Probiotics** again and started the second refill of metro plus **boric acid.**

On **July 24th** I started taking [Vitamin D3](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DN4VCA2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and [Vitamin B Complex with Vitamin C and Folic Acid.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014D2GEK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

*( I haven't stopped taking these and I take them every day.)*

**August 4th -** When my period went away I still had the same symptoms. just swollen and red, and itchy, watery discharge.

**August 11th**  I called my gyno and she barely let me talk and she just gave my fluconazole and another round of metro. I ordered a new probiotic [AZO Complete balance](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074BLLV81/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

**August 12th - August 22nd:**  Metro, Fluconazole, probiotics,

**August 29th:** Still hasn't gone away so I got another type of probiotics to go with the Azo ones. [Culturelle Women's](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079G4N8K2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

I have stopped taking boric acid because I think it was making it worse.

**Sept 4th-Sept 18th:** Got a new gyno for a second opinion and she was incredibly sweet and empathetic and familiar with everything BV. I told her this exact timeline, and she said this is a chronic thing sadly so we might have to just manage it with boric acid and probiotics. But only if the antibiotics she was going to give me didn't work... [SOLOSEC](https://www.solosec.com/). It was in backorder so I didn't get it until the 17th of September.

**Sept 18th - Sept 28th** I took the Solosec (one dose of granules in yogurt), while still taking the Azo (**5 billion**) and the Culturelle (**15 billion**) and I added [Renew Life](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CCCNISU/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) ( **90 billion** which is the highest of the probiotics I've taken) , and I added a vaginal suppository called [Probaclac](https://www.probaclac.ca/vaginal-probiotics-for-bv) ( **8 billion** per capsules a 14-day treatment but I did 7) and [Trader Joes Plain Kefir](https://images.app.goo.gl/jqLAVQb6f7YffTaC9) a cup every morning and keep in mind still taking the vitamins.

At this point, I felt a change, day, and night change... but I HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS NORMAL ANYMORE. No watery discharge, no itching, my vagina wasn't swollen or red anymore... It's never looked this pink and ""normal"" in a long time. But I still had yellowish greenish discharge so I was not convinced.

**Sept 28th - October 2nd** I had my follow-up. I even told her that I wasn't convinced I didn't know what was normal anymore I cried a bit. She examined me, and I begged for a full panel of everything and she did. She also said that everything in there looked normal, but had to wait for the results. She asked what probiotics I was on and at this point, I had run out of AZO and Culturelle, and was taking just Renew Life 90 billion and she said this was great and that she recommends anything above 30 billion.

**October 2nd:** Got the call that everything was negative. I even said "" NO WAY!"" in the call and the lady laughed.

**October 4th:** I got my period and I still have it. So I will see what happens after and I will make an update next week when it's gone.

I promise I will make one because there are people who say they will and they don't.

If you asked me what helped I think it was just all the probiotics I took at once ( a total of 166 billion a day plus the Kefir Milk with live cultures) after the one dose of Solosec.

I still have 7 days of the probiotic suppositories just in case. I will give it a week after my period to see.

Because... I'm still not convinced haha.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

UPDATE: october 16th

It's been a week since my period ended, and I have no signs of BV. My discharge is slightly yellow but I'm starting to realize that it might be ""my"" normal discharge.

I'll be back in 3 weeks with a monthly update.

still BV free, so I'm p sure this time is for good.

Once I switched to tampons, I started to be OK with having my period.

ia3smc,WomensHealth,1597479928.0,"WARNING: please don‚Äôt read if you are squimish because I go into a few graphics details about child birth.

There are a hundreds of topic I could go into here but my own personal experiences are unexplained infertility and dysmenorrhoea. 

My dysmenorrhea is debilitating. It will floor me whether I‚Äôm at work, at home or in the supermarket and I have passed out from the pain before. The most they will do in the UK is scan you for fibroids, do a blood test or two and generally the results come back normal. The next step is then to dose you with hormone-affecting drugs like the Pill or Mini-Pill to basically just mask the issue rather than getting to the route of the problem.

I really wanted to try for a baby but the thought of coming off the pill frightened me. For 5 years I suffered excruciating pain every 26 days whilst I tried to get pregnant naturally and then eventually successfully through IVF. I had plenty of tests done for infertility and nothing abnormal was found (again) and it was classified under that good old fashioned term ‚Äúunexplained infertility‚Äù. Like we‚Äôre living in the 19th century where modern medicine isn‚Äôt a thing.

I am so privileged and eternally grateful and that I was able to get pregnant and deliver a healthy baby but the birth experience was also weird. Irregular contractions throughout, kept passing clots the size of tennis balls whilst I was labouring and I could tell from the midwives expressions it wasn‚Äôt normal. I had to have a blood transfusion afterwards. But in my debrief they couldn‚Äôt tell me what went wrong, what the clots were, why the contractions were never normal.

My pregnancy and labour notes were not digitalised, they were in a folder that I had to carry around with me to every medical scan or appointment (UK mums will know what I‚Äôm talking about). There is no centralised resource for my sexual health, no possible chance for them to cross reference my GP notes on my dysmenorrhoea with my infertility tests and finally my birth story and work out what‚Äôs going on. And this drives me MENTAL.

I am 28 now. I have been pregnant before, and terminated it. I have no regrets, no shame. I made the right decision. When I found out, I cried. I was terrified, and so so angry at myself for not being more careful. I was lucky, and eternally grateful, that the father was supportive of my choice, despite being easily the most abusive person I have ever had the displeasure of being with. That was one of the things he did right.

But I can't talk about it. I can't talk about my desire to never have kids, I can't even just mention it in passing. Why? Because that opens the door to other people's opinions, and absolutely nothing I say will get them to stop.

I get it. I'm good with kids. But why does that automatically have to mean that I should want them? Why does that automatically negate the fact that the entire time I'm interacting with them, I'm screaming on the inside?

After 5 minutes of intense cramping and 3 different forceps (one to just hold my IUD in), she pulled out a MASSIVE (about penny sized but everything feels huge when it's in your body and you're freaked out I guess) wad of hair and blanket fuzz that was wrapped around my IUD strings. I have to go back in 3 weeks for an ultrasound to make sure that my IUD is in the right place, but everything feels okay for now.

I have some cramping still, is that normal? I experienced a lot of pain when they were digging around so I assumed that this was just the aftershock of that so to speak.

OK, so feel free to say that I'm crazy, but I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this.

So for the last year I've been working from home. My husband can't work due to chronic illness. 
We live in a 2-up, 2-down terrace (it's cosy and I love it, but there's not a lot of space), so for a year we've been together constantly. Sitting side by side on the sofa all day, every day. 

Anyway, the last few months or so I've noticed a weird pattern. In the week preceding my period, my husband (we'll call him N) will start to ""mirror"" my symptoms. He gets spots, is super hungry, and has proper full-on mood swings. 

For example, my period is due tomorrow (according to my tracker, and it definitely feels like it is). N has had a proper skin breakout this last week, constantly snacking and is feeling so irritable. What prompted me to post this was that N was playing a super laidback game on Xbox, and suddenly got incredibly annoyed when he couldn't complete a level. He turned it off, turned to me and said, ""I'm really sad and angry and I don't know why."" 
And all I could say was, ""yeah, me too. Sucks, doesn't it?"" 

And this is not the first time. Like I say, I really started to notice it a few months back. 

The thing is, if he was super involved with tracking my period, I'd say it was psychosomatic. But he's not. It comes as a surprise to him every month, basically. 
And I'm not regular as clockwork, either, ranging from 20 to 27 days or so. So it's not that he's subconsciously anticipating my cycle.

Or am I just being crazy?? Has anyone else experienced anything like this?

TLDR; it seems like my husband gets PMS along with me - has it happened to anyone else?

original post:


I just had a big cry fest at work and again in my car because I'm so confused and upset, so forgive me if this post is a mess.

I've been dealing with recurring yeast infections since I started hormonal birth control LAST OCTOBER and I genuinely don't know what I'm doing wrong... kinda just wanna throw the whole pussy out rn. just get rid of it. sex becomes painful after a while anyway so what's the fucking point.

used NuvaRing for about 4 months before calling it quits, and now I've been on Nikki for almost 3 and I'm still trying to deal with this. I'm so tired of feeling dirty. it's starting to really, really affect my self esteem and sex life. I'm going to make an appointment at a second gyno much closer to me for a second opinion on why the hell this keeps happening, but they're also a religious organization and I'm worried they'll just blame it 100% on the birth control and tell me to stick to condoms or abstinence until marriage, rather than help me come up with some kind of solution. like I understand they won't prescribe birth control because they don't agree with it morally but I'm so afraid of just getting written off... I just want to know why other people can take a pill and be fine and I have to have cottage cheese crotch every other weekend

um well if you made it this far props to you. I currently take renew life probiotics, change out of damp underwear or use a pantyliner if I can't change, I don't douche or put shit up there that doesn't belong, I don't know what else I have to do to just have a normal vagina and it's wrecking my self esteem.

okay thanks

x5nls7,Healthyhooha,1662299848.0,"So to start off, at first I would literally eat fast food every day, drink sugary boba teas at least 4-5 times a week, drank coffee every single day and ate absolutely no fruit. I was wondering why my vagina would smell so bad so I bought the Monistat feminine wash to help. I noticed the smell was better but the inside of my vagina still smelled. (like i would pee and it would be smelly and I would wonder why my vagina smells bad on the inside.)

&#x200B;

So I decided I would add some better foods into my diet not for my vagina at first but because I noticed my weight going up and it was affecting me mentally. I started off cutting down on fast food entirely. I'll still eat it maybe 2-3 times a week but very rare. Instead I now eat oven meals from my HEB store that has the prepackaged food with a protein carb and a vegetable. I also decided to buy popping boba from amazon and buy some diet green tea from Walmart with 0 sugar and drink boba drinks that way to cut down on bad sugar. I haven't drank coffee for 11 days now. I'll bring that back in gradually but not right away. Maybe like once-twice a week. 

Now the biggest help I feel has been adding fruit into my diet. Watermelon, strawberries and pineapple I feel have helped tremendously but mostly strawberries as I eat those daily with chocolate hummus. Along with peeing alot more due to the watermelon and strawberries, my pee no longer has a bad smell! I also havent used the Monistat fem wash for 11 days as well.

TW: HORRIFYING AND BLOODY

This was after my second ER visit had misdiagnosed me with a yeast infection and a UTI. I made my way back the next day when the issue had only gotten worse. Unbelievable labial swelling, I'm talking 5x its normal size, very painful and I was barely able to walk, totally out of it.

They finally have an OBGYN look at me after hours of waiting around, and the first thing she does is gasp, physically recoil, and say, ""Oh honey, that must hurt so bad."" I start bawling, and they end up deciding to drain it, which was the worst pain of my life. I screamed and bawled, and about four or five tablespoons worth of pus came out, and they're currently analyzing it in the lab figuring out what's causing the infection. There's another abcess they haven't touched yet, it's more internal, and a growth in one of my ovaries they say they might have to cut out, warning me that this could render me infertile. They said if I'd waited any longer I'd have been at risk of going septic.

If all goes well they're sending me home tomorrow with a home health plan, the day before my classes start. Not gonna lie, I still feel sore and kind of like death. I'm nauseous and in a good deal of pain, sore all over and I've got no energy at all, but I'm just glad it's being sorted out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/kyvij6/unhealthy_hooha_and_the_worst_possible_start_of_a/,Unhealthy hooha and the worst possible start of a New Year UPDATE,,133,23,0.99,sad-wendall

I love how engaged everyone is on this sub, we are an incredible community that come together to help all who come here for help but ureaplasma IMO is getting thrown out way too much.  I agree it is more prevalent than previously believed by the medical community and does **contribute** to the cause of other vulvo/vaginal issues but not all and certainly not as many as being suggested on this sub.

Please try to make sure that you are providng reliable and **sourceable** information so we are not contributing to the spread of poor info on the internet.

There is an enormous amount of things that can go wrong with the vulva/vestibule/vagina and when someone comes here asking for help with pain when urinating or upon penetration, or having ""unusual discharge"" with no other info provided, we need to dig for more info to properly help the sufferer narrow things down instead of jumping straight to ureaplasma.  

Even if the person gets tested and is positive, this may only be a portion of what is actually causing their sufferage and stopping at a diagnosis of ureaplasma will only delay their healing.  Many antibiotics have a side effect of anti-inflammation which makes you feel a lot better but then your issues start to return once the prescription leaves the body and this can cause a person to be frustrated all over again possibly losing faith and hope in turning to communities like this one for help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/h9h8pi/its_not_always_ureaplasma/,It's not always ureaplasma,,135,18,0.96,Thelastunicorn80

112hc4i,Healthyhooha,1676411829.0,"I‚Äôve (37/f) been suffering from yeast infections for 3-4 months. There are multiple GPs at my GP practice and I usually get assigned to whoever is next available (we have a GP shortage in NZ) and for the last 3 visits they have all been male.

All they did was to ask about my symptoms and ordered me to take my own swabs and various tests (blood tests, smear, BV, STI were done by a nurse). One was quite hung up on the fact that despite having all other common yeast infection symptoms, my discharge (as least what I thought) was not necessarily ‚Äúcottage cheese‚Äù like. All the tests came back negative except candida. And all they were giving me was just clotrimazole and one-off Fluconazole.

The medication above do take care of the symptoms for a week but they always return a week or 2 later, just like clockwork. 

I have asked one of the male GPs if he can just take a look at my vagina to see what is going on down there but he didn‚Äôt think it was necessary. When I asked him to refer me to a gynecologist he almost laughed at my face and told me not to use tampons even though i had been using tampons for the last 20 years.

My partner said I should go to a female doctor because men don‚Äôt get it. At first I thought he was being ridiculous, but he brought up the fact that women often find male doctors dismissive. Three weeks ago when another episode of itchiness erupted, I called my clinic and asked for a female doctor. The wait was so much longer but I booked it anyway.
During this period my symptoms have come and gone and come back again after a round of clotrimazole. 

Today as soon as I met my new female GP I told her about the research I‚Äôve read on the New England Journal of Medicine on weekly Fluconazole for six months as recurring yeast infection treatment. She was happy to give it a go as long as another candida swab test comes back positive.

She performed a proper physical exam on my vagina and took the sample herself. She saw the discharge inside and said it does look like I have yeast infection. She noticed all the scratch marks on my vulva and understood how much I had suffered. 

In the meantime she prescribed me clotrimazole, promethazine and glycerol for temporary relief. She booked me in for another appointment three weeks from now to look at the results instead of telling me to ‚Äúcome back when you itch again (but by then the wait to see me will be 1.5 weeks)‚Äù

ky6vzf,Healthyhooha,1610753832.0,"Hey guys first of all for anyone suffering with their hooha I hear you it‚Äôs the most uncomfortable and awkward situation to be in !
I‚Äôve had recurrent yeast infections for 2 years  i never had normal discharge and constantly suffered with lesions, cuts and swelling . To see a gyno it took me a full year (crazy waiting lists here) and after two appointments they said they couldn‚Äôt help me and that maybe it was ‚Äònormal‚Äô for me - not helpful whatsoever and left me suffering .
I tried pessaries creams flucozone and vaginal probiotics and all the usual recommendations non bio washing detergent cotton knickers  etc but nothing worked longer than a few days what seems to have worked for the past month-

1. I went off birth control -I really think this was most of the problem. I had been taking it for several years and after a few weeks of a break things started to improve I also think my vagina started to self clean again as I had discharge for the first time in years .if you are really struggling try a break if you can.
2. Oral probiotics- for some reason these worked a lot better than the vaginal ones directly .I completely doubted their effectiveness and never bothered with them . I take rephresh or optibac for women and they are definitely worth a try too.
3. I don‚Äôt use any shower gel at all anymore and wash my hair separately .I use dove sensitive bar all over not just down there and I only gently rinse internal Labia with water . Also make sure it‚Äôs completely dry after shower gently pat !
4. If you‚Äôre in serious pain what helped was good quality toilet roll don‚Äôt wipe but pat and most off all use aquaphor regularly throughout the day and after showering /wiping  it helps so much with any irritation when nothing else would !
5.try give yourself a break from sex for a few weeks to allow for a recovery of skin.
6. Same goes for shaving -grow out that hair for as long as you can and let it do it‚Äôs natural protecting !
7. Sometimes vaginal irritation can be exacerbated by weak skin around the area. I started taking multivitamins too so may have contributed its worth adding to your routine 
8. Lastly I am convinced things got worse down there when I was stressed out so chilling out probably helps too easier said than done

8gtpq3,Healthyhooha,1525381019.0,"So I recently got a bidet off Amazon after thinking about it for a while. I lived with a roommate up until about a month ago and didn‚Äôt want to get one then because we shared a bathroom and she would have thought it was weird. Now, I initially thought it sounded horrible and weird...cold water spraying directly at my butt/hooha?? No way!

However, I‚Äôve had a chronic issue with hemorrhoids and hate using toilet paper. Even wipes can cause irritation for me. I also live alone now. So I finally got the bidet and installed it yesterday which was actually super easy to do on my own. Coincidentally, I also have a yeast infection right now (went to the dr today, doing my meds tonight so I‚Äôm fine) but I‚Äôm having intense soreness and itchiness down there. 

It took some determination/courage haha but I finally made myself sit down and turn the knob to turn on the spray and WOW! At first it shocked me but then I felt the most amazing relief when the cool water hit my vagina. Also, I can see how this thing gets you way cleaner after a #2 compared to toilet paper.  Not to mention how much TP you could save by using this. 

I have an IUD and don‚Äôt have periods much anymore, but a bidet would also be super helpful at those times too! And even after sex when you want to feel clean down there but don‚Äôt want to jump in the shower. I wonder if they might even reduce the risk of getting UTIs?

Anyway, I thought I would post about this here because I wanted to share how amazing I think these bidets are for not only cleanliness of the backend, but also the front end! If you think it sounds weird and gross, I promise it‚Äôs so much better than just TP.

I explored every antifungal pill and cream available, even experimented with the candida diet, but with no success. This ordeal strained my relationship with my partner, who also suffered from yeast infections after intercourse. The infections seemed to vanish briefly, only to return as stubbornly as ever. Despite visiting eight doctors and three trips to the ER, no one could offer a solution. 
After enduring this for two years, I was referred to an infectious disease specialist who conducted a swab test to identify the specific strain of yeast and its drug resistance. It was determined that I had Candida albicans, which was resistant to all antifungal treatments except for an IV infusion called micafungin.

I can even taste myself on him, and it‚Äôs fine.

About 2 weeks ago i posted about my pregnancy dilemma, with my daughters dad, On a different subred. I got some really good, honest advice and only a few days ago after thinking hard for those 2weeks, decided on abortion. Nothing has happened yet but a procedure will soon be in motion. And it was one of the Hardest decisions iv'e ever made and i am honestly scared to go through it even as an adult woman.  Now, all i see is Post after post, story after story, news announcement after news announcement about it all.

It feels so surreal. I am grateful that i was born and live here and have this choice but I also feel heartache for all the woman and little girls who are living that reality. I even feel guilty because i didn't want to make this choice but after some reflection i know it is for the best for me, for now. I wish i was in the position to care for a lil baba again. I already have 2 little girls, my relationship with the father isn't too good and financially/physically it would be a huge struggle.

I believe All woman and young girls Should have that choice because mistakes happen all the time. Woman/young girls get forced into sex and raped, and reproductive coersion is a real thing too. It's all very disheartening.  And i wish i wasn't in this position at this time right now.

ou22rt,Healthyhooha,1627579826.0,"After MONTHS of testing, doctors appointments, research, and tears, I finally have gotten some answers and I wanted to share my experience thus far in the hopes that maybe it'll help someone. I'm a 24 cishet female for background. I've only had sex once since April, so knew it wasn't a partner passing it back and forth. I take probiotics, only wear cotton underwear, use unscented laundry detergent, only use fragrance-free soap (don't let it near my vulva). 

April/May: Noticed typical YI symptoms (clumpy white discharge, itching, burning with peeing). I've had YI's before so I started treatment immediately

* Monistat 1-Day - didn't work
* Monistat 3-Day - didn't work
* PCP prescribed me 2 rounds of 3 doses of fluconazole - didn't work (just made me incredibly nauseous)
* During 2nd round of fluconazole, tried boric acid suppositories. Within 3 days symptoms disappeared
* Tested for YI, BV, trich - all negative
* YI symptoms come back, I believe triggered by lube. 
* 7 days of boric acid - symptoms clear

June

* YI symptoms come back. 14 days of boric acid - symptoms clear
* Tested for YI, BV, trich - all negative
* Test for GBS - results positive, but rare meaning most likely not cause
* Treat GBS with amoxicillin - no effect

Around this time, based on my own research and the symptoms, I begin to suspect ureaplasma

July

* I have PIV intercourse (w/ condom, no lube) - symptoms immediately come back
* 7/21: Tested for YI, BV, trich, chlamydia, gonorrhea, UTI - positive for YI and BV
* Currently treating YI with course of 3 doses fluconazole + 5 nights of metronizadole gel for BV
* after harassing both my OBGYN and PCP and getting pushback, manage to get a mycoplasma/ureaplasma test
* 7/29: test POSITIVE for ureaplasma
* today will begin treatment for ureaplasma with 10 days doxycycline, twice a day

Although it sucks that I have ureaplasma, I am so immensely relieved that I FINALLY have answers. I only was able to get a swab for mycoplasma/ureaplasma after annoying the hell out of both my OBGYN and PCP, but it was so worth it because now I have answers. Hoping the months of misery will finally end once I treat the ureaplasma.

I've had constant yeast infections for a year. They might not not be over, who knows. But it's been a month since the last one and I'm still treating it over time. I have learned so much during this time about hygiene and taking care of my vagina. It's a whole process of learning to love it and I'm learning to recognize that it's a form of communication since my infections are probably psychologicaly induced. It's my body telling me there's something wrong in my life and I need to work on it.

But I'm here today to share my relief with you. My vagina feels healthy. I never had bad hygiene, but I learned so much about how to clean it properly. It's clean. It has healthy discharge. It feels smooth and soft and inviting instead of disgusting. It smells nice and fresh (from the probiotics and high water intake).

x54l2v,Healthyhooha,1662238572.0,"Let me start off by saying this is going to be long so bear with me. 

This all started about a year & a half ago. I was experiencing a burning sensation during sex, which I had in the past from time to time, it would often just resolve itself (I have some trauma so I always thought that there might be a connection). This time, however, it didn't. 

This progressed to being so painful, I couldn't be penetrated whatsoever. At this point I had tried treating myself with over the counter BV medication, which didn't help. 
I started occasionally getting itchy around the entrance of my vagina & my labia minora. I then tried otc yeast infection medication. Everything was pretty irritated so I waited a week before I tried another round of BV medication when I noticed it didn't go away, then took another round of YI meds. 

After none of these worked, I went to see my family doctor/PCP. I thought maybe it was BV again because, I had just taken YI medication & it wasn't helping. I also find that my BV and YI symptoms present virtually the same, so I usually need medical intervention to determine the cause if I can't figure it out on my own. (I've always had heavier, thick discharge from birth control, & don't have excessive watery discharge with an odor even when I'm BV+)
She noticed that my vulva & my groin looked red and irritated, and she suspected yeast. She did a PCR that came back positive for BV, so I was prescribed antibiotics. 

The itching seemed to have subsided at this point but the pain and burning was still there. I figured I just needed to let my skin do its thing & heal, it was irritated for so long, after all. Boy was I wrong. 

September 2021 rolled around.The itching became constant, severe & I could not find relief whatsoever. Luckily, I had a long overdue PAP scheduled (these types of examinations were put on the backburner for clinics because of lock downs province-wide). During the procedure she said that it looked like yeast & gave me a prescription for YI medication. 

But surprise!! It didn't work. Again. I went back, she gave me a different oral medication, which ALSO didn't work. She then tried me with the same medication one more time, but a longer course, for 2 wks. I gave it another week before I decided to make an appointment to let my skin settle. This led me into to December. 

Over Christmas holidays I experienced searing, burning pain & relentless itching and irritation. It was the most intense I had ever felt in my life. I booked an appointment for another examination. She said that, again, it looked like yeast. And if it came back positive I may need to go on a month long course of anti fungal meds. My doctor did a PCR to check for BV & yeast. BOTH came back negative. 

My family doctor was on maternity leave by the time the results came back. The doctor that's been filling in for her suspected it was hormonal. We switched my birth control 2 times with no improvement. She suggested a third and I told her I wanted to go off it completely to see if things would level out on their own. No change. 

Finally, in February,¬† she put me on a waitlist for a biopsy with a Gynecologist and prescribed me clobetasol because she suspected a lichen disorder but needed a biopsy to confirm. There's a long wait here in Canada so she began lichen treatment until the appointment. The skin was so irritated that it was peeling off. I stayed on clobetasol for 6 months, taking it once a day which became less and less effective.
This brings me to yesterday, the day of my appointment. 

After the intake assessment with the nurse, the Gynecologist did an examination with a speculum. She took one look at me and said ""I know your doctor ruled out infection, but you definitely have a severe yeast infection. It's so invasive that it's spread to the surrounding tissues and has infected your skin"" I was shocked. That couldn't be possible, could it??? My last PCR was negative for yeast. 

I have two possible theories:
1 - the PCR didn't test for every type of yeast and I had a different strain. 

2 - I took so many oral YI meds, but didn't treat it topically to the surrounding tissues and skin in my groin, perineum, etc. So even though they swabbed me, my discharge was clear, but everything else was not. So I got reinfected internally when it spread back inside of me after treatment. 

I think it could be a combination of both.
My Gynecologist asked me if I was diabetic or immunocompromised, because this kind of YI isn't typical of healthy people. HOWEVER, the combination of OTC BV and RX BV meds and also the multiple courses of antibiotics for wisdom teeth abcesses in the last year or 2 messed me up - BAD. So much so that I must have never recovered. I also definitely had BV and a YI at the same time at one point. 

My gyne prescribed me two medications, and to take a baking soda sitz bath before I applied them: terconazole internally and a compound cream of nyaderm and hyderm to the skin infection. She told me this will take a lot of work, and even after this 10 day course, I will probably not feel any better but it's a start! I'll have a follow up in 2 weeks time.

I had first orgasmed in elementary school with my shower head before I even knew what I was feeling, and I did it a lot. I am now 25.


There‚Äôs no way I could ever orgasm all the way with just a hand, even my own, or oral or grinding or anything. I figured I‚Äôd just have to deal with it and never talk to my husband it, but I gathered up the balls to suggest using a vibrator and he was pretty supportive about it. We have tried using the vibrator twice now and I still haven‚Äôt orgasmed with him. It‚Äôs even hard to do it on my own sometimes and bringing in another person is just not what I‚Äôm used to. But I want nothing more than to be able to do it with him only and never on my own again. I‚Äôve only ever been with him and we‚Äôve been having sex for nearly 9 years. But even with recently implementing him using the vibrator on me, I still can‚Äôt :( idk if it‚Äôs just all in my head and is new, or if I have extra skin/‚Äúclitoral hood‚Äù covering my clitoris (called clitoral phimosis) and that‚Äôs why It‚Äôs never been easy for me... TMI but I try to look and see if I can see my clitoris but I just don‚Äôt know if I can or what I‚Äôm really looking for. I‚Äôm going to the gyno next week to talk about birth control so I may bring it up... I just feel like a sexual failure. I love my husband so much and I want to give him this part of me, I‚Äôm just very discouraged. 


I hear about my friends being able to orgasm with their partners without sex toys and my mind is just blown because that never even remotely seemed like a possibility for me. My husband suggested not using the vibrator on my own for a few weeks and we will try again. Is it desensitized because I‚Äôve been using hard pressure my whole life? Am I just mentally not in a right place to orgasm using a vibrator with my husband yet? Is it possible I have too much skin covering the clitoris?? obviously no one will know the actual answer, but does anyone know of a situation like it? Do you know of anyone who had a clitoral hood reduction?

jmjnyk,WomensHealth,1604304548.0,"Hi everybody, I am the girl who went from worrying about her ovary being dead to finding out that she had ovarian cancer. So, I have somenew developments that I would like to share...more specifically, something that is most likely the cause of my cancer. 

So as I may have mentioned in previous posts, ovarian cancer tends to be extremely rare in those who are still in their childbearing years. It was to the extent that, as soon as I (26F) was informed of my diagnosis, I was sent to give blood samples for genetic testing. There are genetic mutations that enhance the risk for ovarian cancer drastically, the BRCA mutations being among them. However, cancer of any kind in my known bloodline is completely unheard of, so until the test results came back it was to be assumed that I simply hit a stroke of sheer awful luck. 

Well, I got the results at my appointment on Friday. I somehow not only have the BRCA1 mutation, but I also have the RAD50 mutation. Going off the paperwork I was given, the BRCA1 mutation bumps the lifetime risk of ovarian cancer from 2% to anywhere from 16-59%. so...we are fairly certain this is the cause of my cancer. 

However, that is not the end of it...it seems that the BRCA1 mutation also bumps the lifetime risk of breast cancer from 13% to anywhere from 40-87%. Not only that, but the RAD50 mutation also causes an enhanced risk of breast cancer, though there is not enough research to say how much just yet. 

Bottom line; I am very, very high-risk...

The plan is that in December, I will be meeting with some high-risk breast cancer specialists to get a better idea of what my options are. The doctor mentioned that on top of extra screening, if I am not willing to go through a mastectomy there are medications I can take to help decrease my chances. On top of that, there is a medicine he has high hopes for called ""parp inhibitors"" that may help me, though we don't know for sure until I meet with the specialists. Either way, I can't start these medications until my cancer treatment is finished. 

The majority of my close blood-family is likely going to get tested as well, and apparently it may be free due to me being found to have these mutations. It will likely start with my mother since she is the only bio-parent who would be civil enough to cooperate from the get-go, then my brothers. Should they wind up testing negative, I have an estranged paternal half-sister as well; it will be awkward as hell to contact her mother after several years, but I will be damned if this girl has to find out about these gene mutations the way I had to, or worse. Nobody deserves that...the only who is definitely not getting the test is my father, as he is technically my father in every aspect besides blood, and isn't linked to the apparent mess that is my genetic code. 

Its just...wow...what the hell is even happening here? Its really hard to wrap my head around all of this, so soon...I am not even really sad about the test results anymore; just shocked more than anything else. A year ago, I would have never, ever expected this; I have always been perfectly healthy until now...life is crazy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/jmjnyk/whelp_that_explains_it/,"Whelp, that explains it.",,129,15,1.0,SubstantialDrawing7

just today, he was telling the class that women are most fertile at around 16 to 24 years of age. he then proceeded to tell us that as girls, we should get married early, because *of course* our main purpose in life is to produce babies. i brushed it off as just some advice for people who might be interested in starting families, although it was very weird. a boy then told him that he wanted to get married at the age of 29, and the teacher said that he wasn't interested in the boys because they would never 'expire'.

at this point i was reasonably angry i think, and i just left the class through the back door. when i came back, i asked my friends if i missed anything, and they told me that he approached them (we were divided into teams) and asked them when they wanted to get married, and stated that married women are generally happier and more successful than unmarried women (also including a comment saying 'look at the unmarried teachers and married teachers in our school. you see a difference right?') ???

i normally tolerate these discussions of his, but i just felt like i needed to exit the classroom today. i do feel like i was overreacting because most of my classmates didn't think it was that big of a deal. idk

zgeflh,WomensHealth,1670539441.0,"Hey,

So I posted on here a few weeks ago - sorry, don't know how to add the link!

A couple of weeks after the doctors found a mass on my ovary the pain came back much quicker and worse than before.  I had walked to the chemist to get a prescription for my daughter and on the way back the same pain as before started except this time I was on my knees unable to stand within 5 mins of getting home.  Went to the gynaecology ward at the hospital where they admitted me.  Everyone was amazing again, they gave me pain medication and the next day the surgeon came to see me and said they would be doing emergency surgery to remove the mass.

They did the surgery and when I woke up they explained they removed the mass along with an ovary and fallopian tube and also my appendix.  The mass had ruptured and this what what bought on the pain.  

It's been 3 weeks since then and I got my biopsy results back today.  They've said I have mucinous ovarian cancer, they think they caught it early, I need to go back in, in January for a full hysterectomy and following the pathology from that they'll know what stage the cancer is.  It's a rare type of ovarian cancer but has a better success rate if caught early so fingers crossed!

So basically again - don't brush off your pain, go and get it checked out. I know I've been lucky with my experience as my doctors were attentive and listened and I know this isn't always the case.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/zgeflh/update_got_my_diagnosis/,UPDATE - Got my diagnosis,Support/Personal Experience ,131,11,0.99,subtlethrone123

ojunsm,Healthyhooha,1626228995.0,"As I‚Äôve been reading through various Reddit posts, I agree that there really ain‚Äôt an incredible amount of information about Bartholin cysts‚Äî particularly on goggle and whatnot so I thought I‚Äôd share my experiences to help with expanding the knowledge.

My history with Bartholin Cysts: 
I‚Äôve been getting them on and off for about the last 5-6 year and had around 20+ total. I‚Äôve been treated medically twice‚Äî the first one and the one I‚Äôm recovering from right at this moment. 

First one:
This one swelled up to about the size of a baseball and was so excruciatingly painful Incant even begin to describe it. I got in on one or two days notice with an GYN and it literally burst in the waiting room as I was waiting for my appointment. Not knowing what it was, I did nothing to treat it before the appointment and they basically just squeezed the rest of the puss out. There was so much I had to have new clothes brought to me so I could leave the office. The pain immediately subsided though and I wore a light pad for a few days and it drained a bit more 

Cysts 2-5
I had 4 more cysts that same summer. knowing what they now were, I soaked in the bath a lot and they all managed to burst. I worked very little that summer and was extremely annoyed and frustrated. 

Cysts 5-20ish
These have happened occasionally over the last 5 years. After having so many, I‚Äôve now found phoebes cure, as well as some other tricks. Very regular warm sits baths, black tea bags, with hazel and castor oil, prid drawing salve, apple cider vinegar, silica/tumeric/black pepper pills. 

All these worked for me in some fashion and all these cysts burst on their own. Do them combined and you have a real solid Arsenal. The worst news though is unfortunately it takes time for them to burst and if you don‚Äôt have a flexible workplace/can‚Äôt work from home/take time off you‚Äôre going to be extremely uncomfortable and your employer is a dick. 

Cyst 21ish
I used my normal arsenal of tricks but I left one out of the above list because so highly do not recommend it. Tree tree oil should not be used and I‚Äôve seen it suggested many times. If not diluted correctly, you can get a ‚Äúchemical burn‚Äù on tour skin down there. I now know this from experience. My cyst did burst, but I was left bed ridden for almost a month and had to go to urgent care when the burns from tea tree oil caused an infection on my skin down there. Please, for the love of god.. do not use tea tree oil. If you do, dilute it aggressively and god speed

Cyst 22 (Now) 
I am now working in a much less flexible work environment and am also 600 miles from my regular GYN. My cyst showed up again, causing me to go to the ER because I don‚Äôt have the ability to spend a week and a half nursing it until it pops. The ER drained and inserted a word catheter and I am about 36-hours post insertion. It hurts. Walking sucks, sitting-just dont, underwear is a definite no, and I‚Äôm hoping I dont have to poop anytime soon. Finding a GYN to take a new patient to remove it is a nightmare. But that can easily be avoided if you don‚Äôt travel/actually have a GYN. 

As for the remainder of recovery and removal, I can it speak to that yet, but I hope that the word catheter is a solution to a recurring problem‚Äîalthough I‚Äôve read many times that it‚Äôs not. 

Where do mine come from:
If doctors tell you they‚Äôre caused by STDs I personally think they‚Äôre full of shit. After this many, I‚Äôve narrowed mine down to every time I wear shorts and most recently now when I wear jeans. Tight fitting clothes is my kryptonite. This most recent cyst was my first due to wearing jeans but in my defense.. because of Covid I‚Äôve worn nothing but leggings and pajamas for the last year and a half and prior to that jeans were not a problem. 

I‚Äôm disappointed with the lack of information on the internet and the lack of interest by our medical community to find solutions to a problem that exists for so many women. It‚Äôs enraging that it‚Äôs not a priority.. but I think we all know why (it‚Äôs not a condition that men have to deal with and it certainly isn‚Äôt life threatening enough to care). 

I feel for all women on here and other threads desperately seeking information and I hope you don‚Äôt ever get as many as I‚Äôve had.  Or any at all for that matter.

l1s6qd,WomensHealth,1611208045.0,"Hi, everyone. I am that girl who went from wondering if her ovary was dead to finding out that she got ovarian cancer through some...less than desirable surprise genetics. So...I have some updates, and thankfully the news is nowhere near as bad as most of what I have shared on reddit throughout the second half of 2020.

Thankfully, the rest of my family has been able to remain together. It has been hard losing my mother, but we are hanging in there on that front. There was a pretty big scare on Christmas Eve where our dog broke out of the house and was gone for 6 hours. We were terrified; she usually opens the front door on her own to get out, but she never wanders off very far, and always comes back after she spends time in the yard. A storm with some really strong winds hit after she got lost, so the poor thing was caught in it. She has the shiniest black coat, too, so we were terrified she would be nearly invisible to drivers. We searched the entire town and were trying to prepare for the worst after all that had happened so far...we started crying together when she showed up at the door soaking wet and shaking after midnight. We found out later that one of the neighbors were shooting off fireworks while she was out, and the loud noises must have really terrified her, and coupled with the storm...well, we gave the poor baby plenty of love and treats. The next day, we were grinning through Christmas morning, because we were just so happy to still have her.


My lungs are doing much better, as well! The last couple of pulmonologist appointments have shown that the leftover fluid is decreasing, so the doctor is saying that while the pleural effusion was not technically due to the cancer spreading to my lungs, the cause was still likely a symptom of the cancer. As a result, the chemotherapy has been shrinking the last of the extra fluid. The doctors can't hear any problems when they listen to my lungs, and outside of some chest wall pain during my chemo crash, my chest has been feeling great! I will never take breathing for granted again. 

As for my cancer, my oncologist has noted that she is feeling great about how things are coming along now thay the pleural effusion has shrunk, and she is really optimistic about the possibility of the next chemotherapy being my last. They told me that after my sixth cycle, they will send me in for another CAT scan to be sure. That scan will tell whether or not I have finally hit remission. So far, I am hoping for the best! 

That said...the next stop will be to finish the job on my hysterectomy. Since the cancer progressed so much, I was told that my best chance of keeping it from returning is to take the remaining ovary, fallopian tube, and uterus out. On top of that, we found that based on the type of tumor, replacement estrogen and HRT will not be safe for me. So...menopause is hitting me early after all. Not looking forward to that...I am also anxious about what the lack of estrogen could do to me. I have heard about health risks, and while there is medication for it, I am pretty worried about the possibilities. 

But there is one thing that I am pretty excited for. The chemo caused the majority of my hair to fall out, but I haven't had it in me to shave what's left...I will be blunt for the Tolkien fans here, I look like I am about to go search for my precious. But a couple of days ago, I was looking in the mirror and under those scraggly hairs, I saw it. I saw that my head is covered in peachfuzz! My head feels fuzzy now...I heard it can start coming back before treatment ends, but I didn't want to get my hopes up about it. I know it will still be a good while, but this gives me hope and relief...maybe with time, I won't be so different from what I used to be. 

So this is where I am now. I want to say thank you to everybody who has offered me their words of support, as it means so much...I'm looking forward to getting stronger and stronger. I do have questions though...if anybody who is reading this has gone through surgical menopause, would you be willing to share your experience on how it went? Does it end at some point, and how bad is it? Are the long-term health risks involved with being cut off from estrogen young something I should be really worried about, even with medication to control it?

I am currently sitting in the emergency room awaiting transfer to a hospital to get emergency surgery (not sure what surgery yet...) because of a misplaced IUD and a swollen ovary that is bleeding. Swollen ovaries have the potential to flop over and twist and could cut off blood flow and die. Woo hoo. 

I came to the ER because, 1 month after having my IUD placed, I started pouring out blood. Literally dripping blood everywhere. I got lucky with a very thorough doctor. He did a pelvic exam, took swabs and samples of everything. I got 2 ultrasounds, one of my pelvis and one of my vagina. I would not have found out I could lose an ovary and potentially die had I not been like ""hmm thats not right.""

If something is wrong or out of the ordinary, you need to call a doctor. Telehealth is becoming increasingly available. Use it!

hipqmr,WomensHealth,1593531667.0,"Here are some things I've learned along the way (feel free to add more in the comments!):

**LOGISTICS**

* Before having sex with a partner, make sure to both get **STD testing** even if you are both virgins. Some STDs are transmitted from mother to child. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. It's also more comfortable to say ""hey I'm getting STD testing soon, you should too so we don't have to worry about it later."" It sounds less like an accusation and more like a mutual collaboration to keep both of you safe and healthy.
   * If he refuses even after attempting to educate him on why it's important, dump/block him. No sex is worth that risk.
* Also make sure to discuss birth control. Is he going to wear a condom? Are either of you allergic to latex? Are you using hormonal birth control or an IUD? Is that not necessary because you'll only be doing hand and/or mouth stuff or you're both women?  (I promise this is better to discuss DAYS before the act to save you from extra awkwardness when you realize you can't safely have sex, or make you risk it and have unsafe sex). You'll also be able to focus on JUST the sex when the time comes because you won't be worrying about logistics the whole time.
   * This should go without saying, but if you are not on birth control/can't get on birth control and he won't wear a condom, reconsider the relationship. Don't make any decisions that would put you at risk, no guy is worth that, especially if he's the one trying to put you in a risky or harmful situation.
* If this is a long term male partner you are going to have sex with, have an **""accident"" plan**. What will you want to do if you accidentally get pregnant? What would he want to do? It's obviously ultimately your decision, but knowing if he would support you and a child or not can help you make that decision easier, and can even help you decide if he's a good partner for you.
   * It's a red flag if he answers with ""whatever you want to do,"" that's a cop out. It's neither owning up to the responsibility of his actions nor expressing his valid desire to not have children right now. You'll essentially be on your own if an accident happened with a guy like that, he'll flake no matter what decision you make and won't support you 100%. However, this kind of guy might be good if you like to be the one to always control situations and take the reigns, each to their own.
* You will want to take a pregnancy test AT SOME POINT while being sexually active, so save yourself the stress and buy a couple ahead of time (they stay good for a long time). **Dollar store pregnancy tests work just as good as the expensive ones!!!**
* Don't be afraid to take Plan B if something goes wrong (condom broke, forgot to take pill, etc). It's best to take it within 3 days of the woopsie. edit: plan b works by preventing ovulation, it does NOT affect an already-fertilized egg, so it won't help if you've recently ovulated. This is why tracking fertility is so important for not just TTC women!!!
* If you have a regular cycle, track it with an app like Clue or Flo. It'll let you know when you're fertile so you can know to avoid sex during that time window or be extra careful (or go extra crazy if you're trying to conceive).

&#x200B;

**THE DEED**

* Even if you are naturally lubricated enough, you're going to eventually need lube at some point and that is totally okay. Sometimes you are extra dehydrated or things are just a little off hormonally. Make sure the lube you use is safe to use with condoms and won't cause an allergic reaction for either of you. **ONLY USE WATER-BASED LUBE IF YOU ARE USING CONDOMS.**
* Before having sex (in general) it's a good idea to get to know your body through masturbating. It'll help you get more comfortable and figure out what you like. This tip is for **everyone: the more stimulation you use during masturbation (vibrator on the highest setting, gripping dick too tightly, etc) the more desensitized you'll be. Being able to orgasm during masturbation with as little stimulation as possible (just fingers, low vibrator setting, etc) will make orgasming during sex easier.**  My male partner and I both had this issue going into our relationship and it took a little while for sex to be more enjoyable than masturbation.
* **If you feel too tight to comfortably have penetrative sex, try pushing out like you're peeing. It relaxes the vaginal muscles (this is one of the best pieces of advice I've ever heard and has saved my life MANY times).**
* Doing kegels and strengthening your vaginal and pelvic floor muscles makes sex much more enjoyable for both parties ;) (for me and my partner, at least).
* Water is **not** great lube. Make sure to be naturally lubricated enough during shower sex.
* **COMMUNICATE**. Say you like it when he does something that feels good or ask him to do something you know you already enjoy. Make sure to ask if he enjoys what you're doing or if there is anything he would like you to do. It's also **MORE** than okay to ask to slow things down or stop. Sometimes you need a breather or an emotional break for a minute, or to stop altogether. It's also okay to compromise, for example, if he wants to have sex but you don't, and you're comfortable giving him a handjob, offer that instead. Or maybe you don't want to have sex but you're okay with getting fingered, I think you get the idea.
* If you can get yourself off but he can't, it's okay to do it yourself during sex (like clit stimulation while you're having penetrative sex). That way you both can have a good time. Most women can't orgasm from penetrative sex alone, so getting a little extra help from your hand or a toy is great and can be enjoyable for both parties.
* Don't be afraid of period sex! Obviously most of us probably aren't even thinking about sex while we're curled up in bed with cramps and rampant emotions, but if you feel good on your light days and ur dude isn't afraid of blood put a towel down and go crazy. My man personally loves it because as he says, I'm ""extra lubed up."" Make sure to clean up beforehand and after with a wet wipe or a shower.
* If you have trouble getting turned on or just don't feel in the mood a lot, work on being physical with ur partner in other ways first. Massages, back rubs, hair petting, spooning, wrestling and play fighting are all great, and you might even find yourself ready for some action after some of them. Also **DON'T FORGET FOREPLAY**. Guys tend to not need a lot of foreplay and can go straight to smashing, but for us ladies it's incredibly important for getting physically and mentally turned on. Don't let him try to skip foreplay unless you are a magical being who doesn't require it.
* This is more of a relationship thing, but **try to make sex just about each other** (unless ur poly or in an open relationship or smthn). If you are going to masturbate, have your partner send you nudes instead of watching porn, and try to get him to do the same. Obviously sometimes a little alone time is needed, but when you can, make sure to orient sexual thoughts and actions with each other, it's very good for strengthening your relationship. **THIS IS JUST A PERSONAL SUGGESTION, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT UNLESS YOU THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA AND WANT TO TRY IT**
   * I'm currently with a male partner who does not watch porn (surprising, I know) and let me tell you, being the source of all of his sexual desires and satisfaction makes me feel very special, and I know he feels the same way since I also don't watch porn. It has also made sex so much better than any previous relationship I've been in (where we both watched porn alone). Maybe it's some biological thing, who knows. Just because it's good for us doesn't mean it'll be good for your relationship, but if you like the sound of it give it a try!
* For the love of god have a towel or tissues in the room beforehand.
* edit: pee after sex!!! it helps prevent UTIs

gdk098,Healthyhooha,1588625859.0,"So I went to my annual exam with a new gynecologist May of last year and everything went well, however she recommended me an intimate soap. I was kinda confused about it because we all know the ‚Äòvaginas are self-cleaning thing‚Äô but I went with it. I used it on my vulva and outer labia and I started to develop excess amount of white discharge. Because I was taking a bunch of pills for acne I didn‚Äôt question it but I was worried I was developing yeast. It made me really insecure and sex had to be planned because I was obsessed with cleaning myself. Well, I started to come off the medications yet the discharge seemed off still. I decided that I would order boric acid and do the treatment. While I waited for the delivery I decided to just wash myself with water taking advantage that I was doing quarantine without my SO. Lo and behold my discharge went from white clumps to very small quantities of transparent liquid, same with smell/taste. Now I‚Äôm so mad I pretty much went with what my gynecologist was saying for almost a year when it affected me so much. And I just don‚Äôt get why would she even suggest it since I wash everyday, sometimes multiple times and never had problems with smell or other symptoms.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/gdk098/why_would_my_gynecologist_recommend_me_a_soap/,Why would my gynecologist recommend me a soap?,Hygiene üßº,130,73,0.94,m14angelica
g9zupn,WomensHealth,1588122393.0,"PLEASE take a test if you think you might be pregnant. Maybe even two if you want. I promise it's more reliable than anything we're going to tell you on here. You can find them at all drug stores, target, walmart, and even order them online. If none of these are an option for you or have limited access, ask your partner/dude you're bangin or even a trusted friend to get you a pack (they usually come in a pack of 2). It's totally normal to stock up on tests and just have them around for situations like this. They're relatively inexpensive for the relief they'll give you (or give you enough time to decide what to do in the small chance you actually are preggers). 

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use protection always if you REALLY don't want to get pregnant. Condoms obviously don't feel as good but having an unwanted pregnancy is gonna feel even worse and won't be worth it (unless you want kids rn, but that doesn't seem to be a common theme in these kind of posts). 

Stress, increase/decrease in physical activity, diet and lifestyle changes can delay your period or make you skip it altogether, **just because it's late doesn't mean you're necessarily pregnant**. You can also still get PMS symptoms during the time your period is delayed, which are all pretty similar to early pregnancy symptoms. 

Remember, if your cycle is regular you can always calculate when you were last fertile (or when you would have been if you're on hormonal BC) by finding your ovulation day and adding a safety net of around 4-5 days before ovulation day and 2 days after. Clue and Flo are great apps for this if you want to be aware of your fertility and are not on hormonal BC or don't have access. If you didn't have sex around this week-long window, the chances you are pregnant are SIGNIFICANTLY lower than if you had sex during it. Flo lets you put in your temperature every day so you can know when you ovulate every month so you can use extra protection or abstain for a while around that time. **But, there's still a chance for pregnancy no matter what because our bodies don't seem to always follow the rules.** So like I said, if your period is late and you think there's a chance you might be pregnant **TAKE A TEST.** If your period is abnormal, these apps can still help with getting a sense of what certain signs can mean in terms of where you are in your wack cycle (like maybe you have very specific PMS symptoms which foretell a period coming in a couple days, on ovulation day you feel different, etc). I started using Clue when my cycle was extremely irregular and it helped me learn about my body so much, I would highly recommend. Now my period is very regular and I switched to Flo because it's a lot more detailed with the symptoms you can log, I would also highly recommend.

So yesterday I went to see my OBGYN due to how much discharge I had been having.  Since it was clear I didn‚Äôt think it was anything serious (it was a mild yeast infection and I got medicine for it). While there I was told I was due for my pap and I also wanted to discuss getting back on birth control since I‚Äôm casually dating and want to be safe in case anything happens. 


Please keep in mind that I‚Äôve had an IUD put in me twice before so I knew it was going to be painful. What I was NOT expecting was for it to be so painful that I PASSED OUT!!! I woke up not knowing where I was at or who the assistant in the room was and I started crying!! It was one of the most embarrassing moments ever. Plus I had never passed out before so I had no idea what the hell was going on.

You know how basically everything has someone influencing in it? So influencers in my country have a loooot to say about vaginal ""health"" and ""hygiene."" A couple of wild things that come to mind:

2. Warm milk and cinnamon for (I'm assuming) increased lubrication during sex
3. Pineapples for... well, yeah.

So the latest thing I've seen going around the internet is ""post-period hygiene.""

Now I have to make sure I take my birth control regularly and on time without missing a day or I will start bleeding right away. My periods have gotten better but the cramps are intense. I lost my virginity at 21. With that same partner I was constantly having yeast infections and BV that never seemed to fully go away. Thinking back I think he might have also been getting yeast infections and it was being passed back n forth. I also got HPV from this partner. Which has not cleared and continued to now be the high risk HPV. I get yearly Pap smears and colposcopies. Which I found out that my cervix is a lot more sensitive than others and that when getting biopsies it takes a lot to stop the bleeding. I am now 25 and with a new partner for over a year. I am still suffering from yeast infections/BV. I am also noticing that I will get thrush if my yeast infection is really bad. So I am assuming I overall have a Candida overgrowth.

gl3e4a,WomensHealth,1589666852.0,"Before you get the wrong idea, I‚Äôm not a part of any hipster cult or weird nudist colony. I would consider myself to be a very average, married, vanilla mid-twenties female. I‚Äôm very new to yoga but I‚Äôm curious to how far I can push my body. And like many women I, too, have body image issues. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù, 170 lbs, and a little thick around the middle. I know I‚Äôm not fat, but I‚Äôm not skinny either. I‚Äôve noticed the changes my body has endured since I‚Äôve become an adult, and some of those are harder to accept than others. There are stretch marks and jiggly parts, scars and blemishes. I so badly want to accept those things, but it seemed I wasn‚Äôt taking the correct steps for it. 

Rewind back about 5 years ago. I got to the point where I was obsessed with my weight. The number on the scale, specifically. I was weighing myself multiple times a day, counting calories, and recording it all. I did see results from it, but that process took a much greater role on my mental health than the good it was doing. I decided to ditch the scale. I haven‚Äôt owned one since and only weigh myself at the doctors office and I find myself surprised at how low my weight is every time. Not that it‚Äôs a significant amount less than I would think, but it reels me back into the reality that I‚Äôm not a huge, enormous cow like I see myself in the mirror. 

The mirror. Here arises the next issue. I‚Äôm a comparer. The older I get, the more I find myself pinching, squeezing, and repositioning my body in the mirror every day. Wishing my boobs were perkier, my thighs touched less, and my muffin top a little less muffin-y. I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs consumed me so much lately, but again I became obsessed with my body‚Äôs imperfections and I‚Äôve even noticed a change in mine and my husbands relationship because of it. It‚Äôs hard to let someone else love you when you don‚Äôt love yourself. 

I‚Äôve been trying to find ways of acceptance and self love through gentle meditation and prayer, but I was still struggling. I‚Äôm working to become more disciplined in my yoga practice due to my extra time at home now (thanks COVID) and have really been trying to focus on the strength my body gives me instead of its physical image during the actual practice. I don‚Äôt know about you, but this has been crazy difficult for me. I‚Äôve always been a believer in facing my problems head on, and today I did just that. I did a little research on the idea behind naked yoga (totally blushing) and decided to really come face to face with my problems. So I got naked. 

I closed all the blinds and locked all the doors. This was to be for me and no one else. I didn‚Äôt even tell my husband I did it, hence why I‚Äôm venting to reddit. But I made it through a pretty intense (for me) practice and by the time I made it to savasana at the end, I laid there with tears in my eyes. For the first time in my life, I was able to accept and love and be proud of my body for what it had done, and during my short meditation I prayed a thankful prayer for my strong, imperfect body. 

Did this solve my self-image issues? Not even close. There were still pinches during certain poses from the extra love I have and it took some serious mental focus to get myself away from those thoughts. It‚Äôs going to take lots of work and a lot less criticism in the mirror to get to a good state and stay there, but I felt it today. I found the peace with myself, physically and mentally. Now, if you read this far, thank you. If this helps one person find that same love for themselves as I got a glimpse of today, then this terribly long post was worth it.

I am a 28 year old female, and I‚Äôm engaged to be married 
We just had sex for the first time. We were both virgins.
We‚Äôve been together for 4 years and we both decided we  wanted to wait until we were atleast engaged.
We are both very connected emotionally and intellectually,
And we are both very sexually attracted to one another. 

The sex wasn‚Äôt majorly painful, but even after I was wet, it was really uncomfortable and tender inside after we were going for while,
Especially in the missionary position, which felt like my cervix was being poked or something, and like my urethra was being rubbed raw. 
I‚Äôm very short, 4‚Äô11, so I don‚Äôt know if that has to do with anything. 
It felt a little better when I was on top.

He was very gentle, and made sure I was comfortable and enjoying it, and was very attentive and listened to me when it was getting uncomfortable. 

I did eventually orgasm, but we had to stop and try something else for him, because it was getting uncomfortable down there. 

I wasn‚Äôt ever taught much about sex, and that‚Äôs really embarrassing to say since I‚Äôm 28. I‚Äôve looked up things about it over the years on google, but after having sex I realized how unprepared I really was for the physical aspect of it.

So I get into the room and she tells me to takeoff my shirt and bra and said that she won‚Äôt be giving me a gown because it gets in the way. I have never ever had this happen before and it made me feel really uncomfortable standing there in the room with my hands covering my breasts until it was time to step over to the machine. It just felt weird not having a gown on. Maybe I‚Äôm over reacting but it just made me really uncomfortable and I‚Äôm confused as to why she would say the gown would get in the way?   Am I over reacting? Has this happened to anyone else?

vaeeeg,Healthyhooha,1655008745.0,"I want all my women, men, & anyone in between to know about ureaplasma. It is not widely taught, however it absolutely should be. This is a parasite that is passed through sexual intercourse, but not considered an std in the US (even tho it is and is listed as an STD in other nations). Most of the time you can have this without knowing, but as it progresses you can often times get symptoms. This is a fairly new infection we have found within the last 5-10 years which we couldn‚Äôt previously see because its SO small, often causes no issues, and we didnt have the tech to find it before. It can cause different types of discharge colors and strong odors and pain in the urinary track/ vagina. (Everyone has different symptoms) This can cause infertility problems in both men and women! A lot of women who have had ‚Äúrandom‚Äù infertility problems actually have had ureaplasma that caused damage. Its resistant against some antibiotics, but doxycycline can usually treat it. Ask your dr for alternatives if youre allergic. I had it for years without knowing. I strongly urge everyone who is sexually active to ask your dr to specifically check for this (as they usually only check for it upon request) because it can cause PID and damage. It can cause damage to mens reproductive health as well. If you have a partner id highly suggest letting them know to get treated too if you have it because if you have sex with them again after getting it treated, often times you can get it again. Please look it up and learn about it, especially if you are dead set on having children or have had infertility issues in the past/present because it can cause problems. Stay safe everyone!‚ù§Ô∏è

**UPDATE
so there is a subreddit specifically for Ureaplasma and I learned the infection can cause Pelvic floor dysfunction!! So if you have any urethral burning, dry vaginal canal, and other symptoms but no infection of any sort pelvic floor exercises, stretches, and breathing techniques can help! Magnesium too! Our body holds stress/trauma in three places, the pelvic area being one of them. Our every day stress has MESSED UP a lot of our body and if you have had childhood trauma, abuse, or any traumatic events in general a lot of that gets stored in our body and can cause problems from the hips down, including lower back pain!! I will continue to post on here often now about ways to release that trauma and get your health back on track!‚ù§Ô∏è 
‚Äîi want you all to know as well many women show different symptoms and different treatments work for different women. As I am not a dr and am just passing along info i learned from my gyno I highly suggest researching it/talking to your gyno or primary care dr to learn more :)

**Second update! Its come to my attention I didnt add some important points to this! So first of all you can get tested by getting a swab done or urine test, however for women a swab is going to be the most accurate test as urine tests dont always find it! Second, theres a lack of knowledge of this STI in the medical community WORLDWIDE and a lot of DRs DONT treat or test for this infection! Its sad and can cause further debt and pain to us, but if your dr wont test for it SEE SOMEONE ELSE! It IS real and you shouldnt let ignorant drs prevent you from getting the help you need! If you test positive and are treated and need to get your partner tested but the dr says you dont need to‚Ä¶WALK AWAY. You can get this sti again if your partner is not treated, so find a DR who will treat them! I do not have a list of Drs who do and dont treat this STI, but on the Ureaplasma subreddit there are some posts listing where you can go in every state in the US as well as a few in other nations! Also if your DR doesnt know about ureaplasma but is willing to help you and test for it they may ask for a test code which you can also find on the ureaplasma subreddit! The link to it/more info is in the comments! Feel free to DM me for link and questions or comment it on this post.

To give some background my boyfriend and I both have decided together that we don‚Äôt want kids. I do want a tubal eventually but I know at my age a doctor most likely wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable preforming that procedure because I'm 21 years old with no kids. It‚Äôs nothing against anyone who does that want or have kids, we just don‚Äôt feel called to parenthood truthfully. And with the state of the world it also would just be best not to have children that‚Äôs just what we prefer. SO I decided to discuss doing the 10 year hormone free IUD, along with my birth control pills to help with my hormonal imbalances and PCOS symptoms. On top of that my boyfriend and I hike and will be taking multiple day long hiking trips and I want to be extra safe as well just in case I forget to take my birth control pill.. I told my gyno about all of that and which she is still going to see if insurance will cover the IUD‚Ä¶. BUT in the mix of all of this she felt the need to interject and tell me that ‚Äúthe reason most couples don‚Äôt want kids is because they just haven‚Äôt found the right person yet. So you may not have found the right person to want babies with yet‚Äù‚Ä¶. Which completely rubbed me the wrong way. So I stopped her and explained even growing up as a child I didn‚Äôt want kids and that I don‚Äôt feel right having kids in such a crazy world and she told me THAT WAS EVEN MORE OF A REASON TO HAVE KIDS! So to me it feels like she invalidated my beliefs and tried to insinuate my relationship wasn‚Äôt valid because we don‚Äôt want to have kids.

I got the Mirena IUD 6 months ago when I was 6 weeks postpartum with my second child. I've never had it but I wanted a long lasting birth control. It was fine for the first month but I started to have some pain, weird bleeding, and a lot of discharge. They did an ultrasound and found it was in the right place but I did have BV infection.

Fast forward 6 months later and I'm miserable. I've gained SO much weight, I'm so bloated, irritable (which I never am), depressed, and worst of all, sex was starting to be super painful during and after (tmi sorry). I went in and saw a NP that I don't usually see and told her all of this. She said my only symptom that could be IUD related was acne. I was pissed. She took out the IUD (I haven't been able to feel my strings for months, something they also knew) and low and behold my IUD was sitting really low. She said my body was trying to expel it and that she's never seen that before. I felt like I was going crazy, that the pain was in my head and that I'd just have to suck it up!!

f7169b,Periods,1582238344.0,"I started getting period symptoms two weeks before my period came - the standard sore breasts and bloating. It was around the same time I experienced the most intense depression ever. For two weeks, I was crying every five minutes, leaving my bed genuinely made me feel sick, talking to other people was so exhausting the second I entered my room I would break down, I didn't pay attention in my classes (failed one of my assignments) and during work I would feel so heavy it distracted me constantly. 

This was different to average menstrual-sadness. I can't even begin to describe how low and heavy I felt all the time.

z97h92,Healthyhooha,1669851862.0,"Hi everyone. I've been lurking here for months looking for helpful info and never posted before, but I decided to finally post because I myself found some info that I thought might be helpful. I wanted to share links to a number of studies I've come across in my research as I try to find a way through my chronic/recurrent, drug-resistant yeast infection, which I've been fighting for over a year. In short, these studies all point to the possibility of IUDs being a major contributing factor in recurrent yeast infections (recurrent vulovaginal candidiasis, RVVC) for many people who have them.

The studies suggest that this is due to candida biofilms forming on the surface of the IUDS, specifically the strings. These biofilms are slower-growing groups of yeast cells covered with a protective layer consisting mainly of proteins that prevents whatever you're being treated with from being able to kill the yeast. This puts you in a situation where you can treat the infection over and over, and every time, kill all of the free floating yeast cells, but more yeast cells will keep on emerging from the biofilm and reinfecting you.

This mirrors the way yeast biofilms can form on other types of implanted medical devices, and cause chronic candidiasis in other systems/regions of the body. This mechanism doesn't have to do with what type of IUD it is, whether it is hormonal or copper; it's as simple as yeast cells clinging to it because it's a static physical object.

There also appears to be a correlation between biofilm-forming yeasts and those that are more resistant to drug therapy even when cultured and tested in the lab (ie, even outside of any biofilm), with drug-resistant yeasts more likely to form biofilms.

Some of these studies also discuss that this can happen with BV infections as well.

I'm putting the links in the comments due to link posting restrictions in this sub.

After reading all of this, I've decided to get my IUD removed (Mirena) in the hopes that it will help my treatments to finally outrun my infection, even though it's the only birth control method that has ever worked well for me. I am not saying that I think everyone else should definitely do the same, but I thought this information might be worth considering for anyone in a similar situation.

qcf2c9,Healthyhooha,1634775929.0,"This is a long one, TLDR; I went to the ER for an incredibly painful bartholin gland cyst. My nurse gave me the most traumatic, excruciating, agonizing experience of my life by not properly numbing me before slicing my vagina open, and even did it after telling her I was not numb yet. 

I get reoccurring bartholin gland cysts, about once a year I have to go to the ER to get it drained. I‚Äôve had them for 7 years. The first time I got it drained, my obgyn didn‚Äôt use enough anesthesia and it hurt REALLY. BAD. After that when I started going to the ER for it because I‚Äôm living in my college town, it was a better experience because they use numbing cream before the injection. The numbing injection is the worst part. It HURTS, but it is significantly better with numbing cream. 

2 days ago I had another one and I started running a high fever which was pretty concerning, so I went to the ER. It was actually the best experience out of all of them. The injection (while it‚Äôs never fun or pleasant) wasn‚Äôt as bad, and as intended, I don‚Äôt feel the ‚Äòslice‚Äô one bit. It really is the needle that really really sucks. 

The next day (yesterday) it suddenly came back full swing. I‚Äôve never had it come back within a year, let alone one day. I took many Epsom salt baths, tried warm compresses, everything. Today it was excruciating. I‚Äôve never had my cyst hurt that bad before. I came back to the ER, crying constantly from the pain. I was about to get sliced again, but I knew because of how irritated and painful it already was, this injection was going to be absolute hell. 

I BEGGED to be put under, while absolutely sobbing. My nurse declined, but I kinda expected that. She pulls out the needle and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwait, can you use numbing spray first?‚Äù She says no. I beg her. She says it doesn‚Äôt work much anyway. I assure her, I‚Äôve lost count of how many times I‚Äôve gotten this drained, IT. HELPS. She says ‚Äúwe ran out‚Äù. It‚Äôs a huge hospital. I highly, HIGHLY doubt there isn‚Äôt a single thing of numbing spray. So I‚Äôm sobbing, terrified, I know how bad this is going to be. So she injects me and I let out this absolute wail/scream/cry. I‚Äôve never heard this sound come out of my mouth. It was the most excruciating pain I‚Äôve ever felt in my entire life. She pokes my cyst with a knife to test if I‚Äôm numb, I‚Äôm not.

Wow I honestly did not expect this much backlash and support from this post. Also don't appreciate some of the names I've been called... But I digress.
I realize a lot of you don't care about the Tampon Emoji and that you think this is a ""first world problem"" but I think it is important to have an emoji that doesn't sweep something COMPLETELY NATURAL under the rug. A blood drop emoji isn't enough. A blood drop emoji can mean a lot of things. I mean maybe I am naive or just a female pms-ing at the moment or maybe I'm feeling entitled. But I think it is important for the younger generations to be more open and not be afraid to talk about periods. It's not that bad! My entire life people have referred to a period as; dot, monthly, pms, red week, hell week, and much worse. They never directly say ""period"" no one ever just wants to say ""period"". So this is a small effort to show that maybe we do need one. No matter how small or insignificant it seems to you.

Women need more recognition when it comes to their periods. Please sign this petition to get Apple to make a Tampon Emoji.

ka70ly,Healthyhooha,1607568999.0,"Okay, am I the only person who has had success with using a zinc oxide cream (AKA literally a diaper rash cream like Bordeaux‚Äôs or Desitin üòÇ) for fishy vaginal odor?!

For the record, there‚Äôs NO way this was normal body odor ‚Äî I would have a fishy smell even right after I took a shower. Over the years, I‚Äôve tried antibiotics, apple cider vinegar, boric acid suppositories, you name it. Boric acid helped, but as soon as I stopped using it, the smell would come back. This wasn‚Äôt a yeast infection ‚Äî I‚Äôve had terrible yeast infections that were always insanely itchy and fixed them right up with Monistat. Was this bacterial? Fungal? Who the fuck knows. The point is ‚Äî the smell was not pleasant and I‚Äôve had it for years.

Anyway, here‚Äôs what I did for THREE DAYS and I haven‚Äôt had any odor since. Again, this is after years ‚Äî years ‚Äî of struggling and wondering what the fuck I was going to do. Though you‚Äôll notice there were some other steps here, nothing *ever* worked without the addition of the zinc oxide cream.

*Step 1* At night, I took a shower & used Babyganics body wash (it‚Äôs a fragrance free thing meant for infants haha) on my vulva.
*Step 2* Dried off.
*Step 3* literally spread Bordeaux‚Äôs Butt Paste (yep) on my vulva ‚Äî do not put this stuff inside your vagina ‚Äî put on a pair of cotton underwear, and went to bed.
*Step 4* repeated the next night.
*Step 5* repeated the next night.

That‚Äôs it. To be clear, I am still only using the Babyganics wash on my more sensitive areas, but using this never helped until I added the zinc oxide cream for a few days.

Am I the only person who has tried this and succeeded?! I have no idea what made me want to do it. I‚Äôm pretty sure someone once told me they used a zinc oxide cream for like athlete‚Äôs foot or something and I was like fuck it, it can‚Äôt hurt, let‚Äôs give it a shot.

Why this worked? I have no idea. I know zinc oxide is a moisture repellent, but that‚Äôs about the extent of my science.

Can someone else pleeeeaaase try this and report back?! It is such a cheap, private, and doable thing, I needed to get the word out there!

j39w75,Healthyhooha,1601563420.0,"Tdlr; My detailed experience getting a colposcopy at 23. Get your checks, but don't freak out, it's fine.

I'm 23 and recently was recommended to get a colposcopy. I saw some people posted about their experiences but it wasn't really a reflection of how mine went. So I figured I'd post. 

My doctor was actually hesitant to go through with the exam because she said that most people under the age of 24 will flush out anything harmful, like pre cancerous cells, but since I am HPV positive this year she was still going to go through with it She made it clear she was on the fence about doing it at all. 

I'm going to give a step by step of my experience so other people who have anxiety can be at ease. So the first thing she does is put in the speculum, this is as unpleasant as always, but a 1/10 on the pain scale because you can ignore it after a while. So the doctor sits between your legs and uses a microscope (looks like that machine you wear to get your eyes checked for glasses) and they take some swabs. Now they have to put 2 solutions on. One is a vinegar and one is iodine. The vinegar BURNED HORRIBLY. It's super uncomfortable, but it dulls over time. The initial shock is a little brutal. I didn't take any ibuprofen but I  don't know if it would have helped. Honestly if I'm not being a baby about it, it's was a 4/10 for pain just feels bad because you're not used to that kind of burn in your vag.  So then she did some more swabs, put in the iodine and did more swabs. The rest feels like a normal pap, you can't feel the swabs that much and it's not that bad. The doctor will move the speculum around because she wanted to be thorough, but all you feel is it moving and some pressure. It's uncomfortable but doesn't really hurt. 

She ended up not doing a biopsy because it looked OK and also I'm young. So she removed the speculum, asked if I had any questions and gave me a pad (because the iodine will give you funky discharge). 

My doctor explained everything really well. She told me that HPV is like a cold for your cervix, which was a great explaination. I feel like gyns in the past have not been as clear or explained things as thoroughly as she did and I often get health anxiety. But now I'm feeling really good and my anxiety is at ease. I'll get my results from the swabs at some point, but I don't feel stressed at all.

j6yvzp,WomensHealth,1602103022.0,"Hi, everybody. I am the girl who went from wondering whether her ovary was dead to finding out she had straight-up ovarian cancer. I had my first chemo appointment and...well, it did not go as well as I hoped. I figured I should update.

The original plan was for me to have three hours of Taxol and 30-40 minutes of Carboplatin afterwards. They managed to get me hooked up to the IV, gave me all of my prep medications, and then injected the Taxol. Of course, they warned me beforehand to let them know if something felt wrong, as on rare occasions there are people who are allergic to Taxol, and if they are it is very likely the reaction would happen within the first 10 minutes of administration. I wasn't that worried at first, because I have no history of being allergic to anything.

Of course that would change near the 10-minute mark, and I am now painfully aware that I am allergic to the Taxol. 

It happened so quickly. One moment I was fine, then felt encroaching nausea and noticed little lights floating around in my vision. I was in the middle of saying something to my friend who was there with me, when suddenly it hit me; my chest felt like it was crumpling, my throat closing, and my tongue swelling a bit. I used my last breaths to scream for help. I felt bad doing that in a room full of cancer patients going through such a hard treatment...but damn it, I was so terrified...It hit so hard and suddenly, and my body was struggling to scream and cough on instinct. I had never dealt with that before...I have also been told that my body was turning interesting shades of red and I had goosebumps everywhere. My friend was freaking out and trying to help them however she could.

Thankfully the nurses gave me some steroids to help me out of it, and they stopped the procedure. They are planning to give me a variant of Taxol that does not have the same mixed compounds, as they claimed my reaction matches up to that as the issue. They kept me monitored for 40 minutes and sent me home, albeit a bit hesitantly due to my low blood pressure (I am so glad I just finished with those blood thinners this morning). We will be trying again on Tuesday.

I feel dead tired...they said that is normal, though.

Bright side, if this variant works, I will only need 30-40 minutes of it compared to the 3 hours the regular Taxol calls for.

nbqvq7,TwoXSupport,1620938491.0,"Sex is something that so many women have a complex relationship to, and something that is so often intertwined with our mental health. I suffer from bipolar disorder which leads to hypersexuality during my manic episodes and I cannot count how many sexual experiences I've had that I've deeply regretted or felt unsafe during. And sure, you can say Bipolar is a niche experience that only...what? 2%? Of the population has. But I've seen women with depression go through this too, turn to sex as a sort of comfort/distraction from their pain. Not to mention women who've recently left abusive situations and are experiencing trauma. Sexual trauma and hypersexuality have been linked in many research studies, with the going theory being that traumatized people turn to sex as both a distraction from their trauma and a way to feel like they're ""regaining their power"", but of course it often just ends up feeling bad and uncomfortable.

I don't know, it just pisses me off that so many women carry the shame of so many negative sexual experiences because it's rarely a conversation that's held widely. Pretty much every woman I know, myself included, has regretted her one night stands, or the sex she had when she was feeling vulnerable and in a bad mental headspace, because sex with strangers just isn't a positive or healthy experience most of the time, and feeling misplaced shame on top of that makes it so much fucking worse.

And don't even get me started with women who \*aren't\* that sexual but feel pressured to be. Women who feel like they need to be into rough sex because some dipshit loser they were dating made them feel bad about not being into it. Or women who feel like they can't be into normal vanilla sex because they've been made to feel like that's ""boring"" and ""prudish"". Or women who feel like they can't not be into sex that often at all, because not being a source of sexual availability means you've ""failed"" as a woman somehow.

I don't know. I want this to be better. I'm sick of seeing women feel ashamed just for fucking existing and being human and imperfect and having complex relationships to sex. And I'm sick of there being very little mainstream advice on how to navigate these situations, how to be safe sexually when you're struggling with mental health issues, or how to establish boundaries around sex as a whole, how to stand firm with your own sexual choices.

Hi all. My 9 year old daughter has woken up this morning and told me that when she went to pee her vagina hurt. Initially I thought she meant her urethra and that she had a urine infection but she said it's her vagina. I had a look and could not see any redness/inflammation but she could not open her legs very wide because she said she felt a tearing sensation. She has now washed with warm water and put some cream on it. 

Could this be her hymen? I don't ever recall mine breaking so I have no reference point. Or is it possible that it's vulvovaginitis? Did anyone experience anything like this as a child? She was wearing a onesie in bed so I don't think she could have scratched herself. We talk openly about body parts and I reassured her that if this happened as a result of her touching or scratching herself she has nothing to be embarrassed about.

c3j4jq,WomensHealth,1561164955.0,"My friends call me Lizard. I'm 24, and I wanted to share my story.

Ever since I was 14 or 15, about 10 years ago, I have had very heavy periods. Like, abnormally heavy. To the point where, around 20, I was soaking through about 10-12 ultra tampons a day and/or changing my Diva cup on the hour every hour. In January of this year, I stopped being able to wear insertables entirely and ended up giving in and buying adult diapers because they were the only thing strong enough to get me through the day without leakage. 

I started going to the doctor for them in my late teens. Nothing was ever found on imaging and a ""diagnosis"" of endometriosis was slapped on me repeatedly by about 4-5 doctors so they could put me on birth control. It worked for about a year before the pill became completely ineffective and my heavy, painful periods returned. Nothing was ever found. No legitimate diagnosis was ever given. Eventually, I gave up for several years and just dealt with it the best I could despite being in enough pain that I'd spend days curled up in fetal position on the floor, lying in the bathtub as I let scalding hot water pour over my abdomen, or bent over the toilet vomiting. Painkillers didn't work, and still don't. I've been on everything from Tylenol to morphine and nothing kills the pain.

Eventually, it got so bad last August that work started sending me home semi regularly because I was in too much pain to move. I decided to see a GYN again, this time at a MayoClinic branch in Southern Minn. Once again, ultrasounds revealed nothing. She suggested a Mirena IUD. I went for it. I expelled it within a month. We tried a second one. Once again, I expelled it. As a last resort, we tried the Nexplanon around the beginning of April this year - by that time i had been on my period for about a month straight with no reprieve. She told me to send her a portal message if I experienced anything more than light spotting and minor cramping, which I did.

The following Tuesday, I received a reply from a doctor that was answering her messages while she was on a week leave that basically told me to take a couple of ibuprofen and suck it up. Lots of women have heavy periods. It's not that bad.

I almost passed out that day on the way to the bathroom.

About a week and a half later, I was sent home from work twice because I was lightheaded and nauseous and throwing up. I didn't think much of it because I had caught a cold that previous weekend. I was supposed to move to Tennessee on the coming Friday, April 26, so I figured I'd suck it up and keep going, because what I else can I do?

Friday April 26 was the day that I passed out in the HyVee checkout line.

I had no idea what happened. I woke up to a store employee who worked part time as an EMT yelling, ""call the paramedics, she hit her head."" I have no idea what happened, just that I felt dizzy one second and was on the floor with a massive gash in my head the next. I got carted away in an ambulance with full neck brace to the local hospital, where they told me I probably passed out because of dehydration, but they wanted to run a blood test just in case. The doctor returned, white faced, and told me that I basically shouldn't have been able to walk. My hemoglobin tested at 6.1, 0.9 units below the threshold for a transfusion.

That's when they gave me the first transfusion. I continued to bleed all night, passing clot after clot the size of eggs. My nurses were horrified when they saw that, no, I wasn't joking about how much I had been bleeding or how big my clots were. It got worse after the transfusions because my blood count had gone up. It was almost like my body had been trying to preserve itself by letting my hemoglobin get so low, and I felt like a leaky tire: every time they tried to put more blood in me, I'd just bleed until I was down near that threshold. They loaded me full of TXA and IV estrogen and dilaudid in hopes of stopping the pain and bleeding. It made me so nauseous I was given Phenergen, after which I started having severe convulsions. Turns out I'm allergic. They gave me Ativan and more dilaudid, effectively knocking me out until the Phenergen was out of my system. 

The bleeding slowed but didn't stop, but it was light enough doctors were able to give me a second transplant on April 28. I was supposed to have been in TN for 2 days at that point. I was supposed to see one of my favorite musicians that night. Instead, I was in the hospital bleeding all over the nice white linens and trying not to vomit as they pumped blood into my system hoping to get my counts up.

I was discharged on April 29 and moved to TN on May 1 with a post-hospital visit set up with Vanderbilt Womens Health and instructions to go to the ER if I started bleeding heavily again, which I did that Saturday. That was my second trip to the ER. It was a smaller hospital near my apartment, so they couldn't do much except check my blood counts and put me on an estrogen taper in hopes of slowing down the bleeding. It didn't work.

At my post-hospital visit, they did a biopsy and an ultrasound, finding several small fibroids and signs of adenomyosis. A week later, my bleeding still hadn't slowed down, so they removed my Nexplanon implant. It took about an hour as the implant had been encapsulated in scar tissue. That weekend, the bleeding became even heavier.

That Sunday, May 26, was my third visit to the ER. Once again, they couldn't do much except call Vanderbilt to ask about it, give me more IV estrogen, TXA, and a few painkillers, and tell me that if I started experiencing shortness of breath, chest pain or tightness, and dizziness that I should go back to the ER and try to go to Vanderbilt since that's where my GYN was. My hemoglobin tested at 7.3.

That Tuesday during work, I became heavily symptomatic. My coworkers called me a Lyft to take me to Vanderbilt's ER. My hemoglobin hadn't changed since that weekend, but because I was heavily symptomatic, I was given my 3rd blood transfusion of the month. Afterward, once again, I started having immense pain and passing clot after egg-sized clot. I was given morphine, which put me out. I was in the ER for 4 days while they waited to find me a room. My mom drove 8hrs to make sure I didn't have to suffer alone. Doctors came and went, but I don't remember much other than crying and saying that I was terrified to go home because I'd just end up back in the ER if they discharged me. I had my 4th transfusion while still in the ER as my hemoglobin levels wouldn't stabilize. The on duty nurse wouldn't give me pain meds or anything to help me sleep, so I threw up about 4 separate times because I was in so much pain, though she claimed I was having a reaction to the blood. If that was the caee, why hadn't I thrown up the last time?

Eventually, they found me a room and booked me in for a hysteroscopy on Friday the 31. They prepped me for surgery, put me out, and then presented both my mom and I with the news:

I have fibroids. The most severe case of fibroids my surgeon of 20+ years had ever seen. He told both me and my mom flat out that he'd only ever seen a handful of cases like mine, and only in women over 35. Never in someone so young. 10 years of going to the doctor trying to get a diagnosis and failing, only to finally get a diagnosis that my uterus was more tumor than organ. I have to reason that they took so long to find because, statistically, people my age don't typically get fibroids. At least, not this severe. It irritates me to know that no one found them before, and that consistently trying birth control and IUDs probably worsened them as fibroids feed off estrogen and progesterone.

They removed the two largest fibroids (measuring 1.5cm and 3cm in diameter) but were unable to scrape my entire uterus. When I woke up from anesthesia, I felt better than I had in YEARS. Since then, my bleeding has stopped, my hemoglobin has gone back up, and I'm starting to get my energy back.

That said, I still have a uterus full of tumors, and the worse the case of fibroids, the bigger the chance that they'll grow back. Even if it won't be for 3-7+ years, knowing my luck, they will be back. I'm currently in talks with my doctor about a hysterectomy. I've bled enough in the past 10 years to have 2-3 lifetimes of periods, and I just want it done.

14hfsw6,WomensHealth,1687570204.0,"I‚Äôm 22/F and I feel like nobody gets it. Every time I have attempted sex it has gone badly - whether it be from vaginismus making sex painful and not even allowing entry, to randomly developing UTI‚Äôs after intercourse - even with both of us showering and being clean before sex and using a condoms, to light bleeding after sex from being overly ‚Äútight‚Äù and causing some minor tears. 

My best friend told me the last time I talked to her that she loves having sex and that it is amazing, and I wish I could relate. 

It is such a pain in the ass to treat these issues though I have just given up. I was in pelvic floor therapy after telling my doctor about experiencing pain from penetrative sex, but I hate constantly being examined by doctors trying to figure out the issue. I hate being poked and prodded, and pelvic floor therapy itself was very uncomfortable because most of the nurses were my age and it felt so stupid having to be there in the first place. I felt as if they were judging me the entire time. And the exercises they had me do felt useless to treating it. 

I think my issue is directly related with having scoliosis, or an unnatural curving of the spine, because the spine is connected to the pelvic floor, and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it is somehow putting stress on my pelvic floor muscles causing them to work harder than they need. But I don‚Äôt know. I do not think it it is directly related to any actual issues with my vagina itself as these symptoms are elusive and not always consistent. But even if it is scoliosis - there is nothing I can do as the only fix is surgery and I don‚Äôt think my curve is severe enough to consider it. But the last time I had an x-ray done was when I was 13. 

Most of the guys in my area do not understand at all the health issues that I am dealing with and think the pain is minor - but the pain I get from penetration makes it feel like everything is on fire if I am not careful. But I have no STD‚Äôs, nothing like endometriosis, fibroids, or PCOS(though this isn‚Äôt confirmed and I am suspicious).

I have had some weird symptoms in the past - like I went two years straight without a period and I swear doctors didn‚Äôt believe me. But after I took birth control for a week my cycle returned as normal and hasn‚Äôt stopped since minus missing a period every now and then. Nobody has bothered trying to explain that one to me and just shrugged it off. But I have always wondered about that.

It kinda burns after I urinate, not during. A little whitish discharge was also coming out but it didn't smell. 
STIs can't be the reason because neither he nor me have had any partner before. Idk about a UTI though. 
It also begins to hurt if I start getting aroused. It has been 48 hours. No I cannot go to any doctor, so please please help me.

it was very frustrating and it made me hate even bringing up any of my concerns. i finally sucked it up and made an obgyn appointment, and was shocked by how easy it was. all i said was that my periods are really painful and hard to deal with, and she was ready to prescribe birth control before i even suggested it. she told me some of my other options but ultimately settled on starting with the pill to see how i like it, and how my body handles it.

jyw6no,TwoXSupport,1606054085.0,"So I thought this would be an interesting thing to discuss but was too frightened of backlash to post on TwoX...

Sometimes I browse AITA and something that seems to come up regularly there is the situation of who is allowed to be in the delivery room (more specifically, men throwing a fit because their partner/the woman carrying the baby doesn‚Äôt want him in the room whilst she gives birth) 

Since COVID, women are only allowed to choose one person and many of them choose their mum rather than the father of the baby - the outrage this provokes on AITA is pretty upsetting - comments include things like...

 ‚Äúif my wife did this I‚Äôd divorce her‚Äù 

‚Äúyou are entitled to be in the room, it‚Äôs your baby too!‚Äù

‚Äúshe‚Äôs a selfish *insert sexist and hurtful word here*‚Äù. 

‚ÄúChildbirth is a beautiful family moment, if my wife took it away from me I‚Äôd never forgive her‚Äù

‚ÄúYou have every right to be in there!‚Äù

I guess I was hoping to hear your opinions on this, personally I think birth is a medical procedure and not a spectator sport and not one person is entitled to be there besides the woman experiencing it. Once the baby is born they have equal say, until then it is entirely the person risking their life who gets to choose (and should be able to do so without being vilified and attacked) 

I think the romanticising of childbirth in media is another factor in the prominence of men‚Äôs entitlement.

It upsets me a lot because I‚Äôm terrified of pregnancy and childbirth and don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do ... maybe I‚Äôd want to be alone, maybe I‚Äôd want my boyfriend, maybe I‚Äôd want my mum (the woman who carried me inside her for 9 months, raised and loved me for 24 years...) To be shamed, called selfish and criticised for making the choice that‚Äôs best for you in a life threatening situation must be really awful. 

I think it‚Äôs totally unfair for the fathers to put their feelings over the woman‚Äôs and tbh, the sense of entitlement to women‚Äôs bodies continues to baffle and frighten me. 

Saying that, I can understand feeling (privately) hurt that your partner didn‚Äôt choose you, but can‚Äôt imagine how you wouldn‚Äôt just want what‚Äôs best for mother and baby during delivery, even if that meant you waited outside.

1ak2b2n,Periods,1707197160.0," So me (19F) and my situationship/gf? (19F) have been seeing each other for the last 5 months sexually but have known eachother for around 9 months. I mention this because we have a really comfortable and honest relationship where we basically feel comfortable doing anything around eachother. But the last 2 times i saw her (we are semi long distance so i only see her every month or so) she has gotten her period. Again, i have zero issue with this (obviously being a woman myself) and even have had period sex. Where my issue stands is that she literally does not wear or use any sort of period product when she gets it with me. No pad, tampon, period underwear, diva cup, etc. nothing - just free bleeding. Her periods are heavy and it gets to the point where she bleeds completely through my bedding and pants leaving huge marks and staining the mattress. I feel awkward talking about this with her since i know she can‚Äôt control her periods. and i know she feels embarrassed by waking up and seeing the blood stains on the bed, but instead of letting me know, she tries to hide it by laying on it or covering with a sheet. also, before we do things, she never tells me that she‚Äôs on her periods and just pretends it‚Äôs not there and even lies about being on it when i do acknowledge it( claims to have heavy nose bleed in the night, cut her leg etc). What put me over the edge was when i gave her my pants to wear for a day, and she again didn‚Äôt wear any sort of period product, and completely bled through my pants AND onto my car seat. Instead of telling me or any attempts to clean the blood out of my pants, she gives me the pants folded so i can‚Äôt see it and doesn‚Äôt say a word or act like anything wrong. I also didn‚Äôt notice until she left and i was refolding laundry.

Should i have the right to feel grossed out? and should I i say anything? i dont want to make it weird.

I only recently learned that what I thought was my ""urethra"" was actually my clitoris, but let's not go there.

Women, please hear me, for I have a clitoris and I am in despair. Due to previous methods of solo-sex, I have damaged my clitoris. After looking at some educational videos, I have found that they do vary in color, size, and shape. Mine has a hole in/near it.

It hinders sex with a partner. No partner of mine has been able to touch it (with anything, not even a gentle graze of their fingertip or tongue) without being in pain.

I know I'm not the only one but I don't see many posts like this! I've managed and gratefully solo-sex is not painful.

I don't know if you ladies would need picture proof to believe me (many have not believed me), but I'm vastly uncomfortable with putting it out on the internet.

I'm also a bit less in despair now that I know more about my body. I had an appointment with a sexual wellness doctor to talk it over. I have another appointment later in December (the 21st) to go over what bits are what with her and what bothers me. She has stated that since solo sex is not painful for me, everything sounds normal to her, which is a relief.

Does anyone else relate? I feel like some people do. I think I've heard whispers about other women struggling with this. What should I tell my doctor so that I feel heard but also so that something could be done?

Hi there. You may remember me from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Periods/comments/14iwrit/can_anyone_tell_me_what_this_is_it_fell_out_of_me/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=1), where I was trying to figure out what fell out of me in the shower. We'll, I have my answer, and it isn't a fibroid after all. After sending it for a biopsy, we discovered that it was necrotic chorionic villi  tissue--basically, placental matter left over from a previous miscarriage, which had become wrapped in more layers of tissue (sort of like an oyster making a pearl) until it got too big and just fell out.

My OBGYN suspects that the tissue is from a 2016 miscarriage and probably caused the two subsequent miscarriages I had by preventing the embryo from attaching to the uterine wall. This could have been prevented if I had ever been scanned for retained products of conception after any of my miscarriages, but I wasn't, and I didn't know enough to push for it.

So this is my PSA: if you have a miscarriage, make them check for retained products of conception after you've stopped bleeding. This has caused me serious health issues, especially with my period (which has been lighter, less intense, and with seriously reduced cramping and PMS symptoms).

We went and got really super drunk out at the bars a month or so ago. We got back to my place and did only hand stuff to each other. I realized only after that we did not remember to wash our hands. I woke up the next morning feeling really itchy and smelly down there, and knew it was BV.

No worries, I took a shower and it seemed like itchy symptoms went away, little smell but not horrible so I thought I was in the clear.

The following week we meet up again and things lead into full on sex this time. During it, the smell came back again from me and I legit smelled like FISH. I have no idea if he noticed (we were optimal levels of drunk this time). My heart sank and I prayed he did not notice. We finished anyway and the sex was great nonetheless. We hung out the entire day after and he even willingly stayed longer than expected, so in my head if there was an issue with it he was chill and looking past it. He was fine hanging with fishy me. 

Idk why I felt too scared to bring it up anyway to clear myself, I guess I did not want him to feel bad for giving me BV.

I made an appointment to get treated for BV but it‚Äôd be a few weeks later.

We meet up again a couple weeks later (before my dr appt) to go to a concert and drink and we have an amazing time. We hang out again for 24hrs enjoying each other‚Äôs company, but this time nothing sexual happens.

We texted for a few days after a lot, and when I mentioned doing the museum thing next week, he stopped responding. That was Friday. 

Now all I can think about is it‚Äôs the fish.

He may be thinking I always smelly fishy.

What can I do to bring this up now? In my head this would be an acceptable dealbreaker for him whether this stays as a fwb or actual dating.

1d024do,Healthyhooha,1716604960.0,"Been seeing one gyno regularly for my reoccurring BV for the past year now. At my last appointment I requested to be tested for ureaplasma, as my BV just keeps coming back no matter the treatment course. 

That gyno told me the office didn‚Äôt offer that kind of test and that she‚Äôd like to try out a long-term treatment plan just to see if that works before referring me out to a specialist‚Äîas I‚Äôve been on multiple rounds of oral antibiotics and boric acid already with no success

Cut to a month into my long term metronidazole gel treatment plan given by this gyno and my symptoms are raging, worse than before I started. She had me start this new treatment plan with another round of 7 day oral antibiotics, and within a week after finishing the oral antibiotics and starting the use of the gel twice weekly, as she specifically told me to do, my symptoms came back raging. 

I read others who were being denied those urea/mycoplasma tests as well and some advice they got was to ask for it in writing so it‚Äôs on your medical record that they denied a test you specifically requested so they can be held liable for it or something like that if that just so happens to be the test you needed. 

So I went back just a month after my last appointment because I honestly don‚Äôt wanna be a guinea pig for this long-term treatment plan the next 3 months, at least not without being diligent about testing for all possible causes and getting to the root beforehand, considering it isn‚Äôt guaranteed to work and my symptoms have only worsened, not gotten better in the slightest.


And this time that usual gyno I was seeing wasn‚Äôt in the office on that particular day of the week so I saw another gyno in that same office. And that‚Äôs exactly what I did. I told the other gyno I specifically asked for the ureaplasma test last time and was denied, asked for the test or a referral to a specialist again and stated if it would be denied I‚Äôd like that in writing‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶and what do you know?! The gyno walked back into the room with not only a ureaplasma test but ALSO a mycoplasma test that I hadn‚Äôt even mentioned or thought of! In the same exact office the other gyno told me they didn‚Äôt provide those tests!

151ck23,Healthyhooha,1689529702.0,"Spoiler alert: Pelvic floor therapy / dilators work, guys.

Background: In March 2022 I had BV and yeast infections back and forth, by summer it was ureaplasma, and by December I was diagnosed with provoked vestibulodynia. My gyno said all the repeat infections caused my body and pelvic floor to feel like it‚Äôs always fighting off an infection so it was always red, burning, inflamed and dry. Sex felt like I was sticking burning sandpaper in there so I gave up trying completely and eventually that relationship ended (for other reasons, not because of no sex). I was also diagnosed with interstitial cystitis.

Current Day: So it had been about a year and a half since I had pleasurable, wet, pain-free sex. After the breakup, I believed no one would want me since I can‚Äôt provide sex and I felt hopeless everyday. But after a few months of using dilators and taking meds and natural remedies, I am thrilled to report that I WAS ABLE TO HAVE SPONTANEOUS PLEASURABLE SEX ON VACATION!! 4 times‚Ä¶ but who‚Äôs counting? (me)

What I did to get to this point:

1. Pelvic floor therapy and dilators: I tried PFT once but it was expensive so I bought my own set of 5 dilators starting from the skinniest size to the biggest. I insert one inch every other night using Good Clean Love sensitive lube. Lightly use pressure on the 12, 3, 6, and 9 o clock areas and eventually practiced penetration with them to mimic the in and out movement of sex. At first it burned and stung like sex but the feeling goes away slightly after 20 min. This cannot be something you try once for 5 min. Practice makes perfect, I‚Äôm still learning as well. Diaphragmatic breathing, soft music, laying down, getting relaxed is key. Graduate to the next size dilator when you stop feeling pain with the current one! Also, the program/website called Pelvic Sense has great stretches, exercises and medical information for vulvodynia. 

2. Find a doctor or gyno who listens, cares, and wants to genuinely help. It took 6 different doctors to find the one I have now‚Äî it is not easy but it‚Äôs so rewarding and relieving to finally find one who is willing to try every possible measure to get you relief. Mine prescribed me gabapentin cream, recommended all the Good Clean Love products, and told me to stop blow drying down there after showering because that was making me extra dry. 

3. Magnesium helps with nerve damage, ashwaganda promotes libido and moisture down there, and d mannose helps with my bladder issues. 

4. Never stop talking about your vagina, never stop seeking help and relief. My family is sick and tired of me talking about my issues but idgaf. The vagina is no different from discussing any other medical issue like having heart problems or diabetes or something. It‚Äôs a painful experience that has affected everything in my life, not just sex. What I wear, what I eat, if I feel like going out, how I sit, how I sleep, how often I go to the bathroom, how much money I‚Äôve wasted, doctors visits, random rawness or discomfort, swimming, the smell down there, my confidence, depression, etc. 

If I think of more that‚Äôs helped me I will add it in the comments but I recommend the dilators most of all. I don‚Äôt feel completely hopeless anymore and I want to share this to anyone who feels like they‚Äôll never be able to have sex or enjoy life or find love.

Then she announced my cervix is really inflamed, she left me on the table with the speculum in to go find additional equipment to get more samples.
She did the thing where they get a sample from the cervix and I reacted negatively by tensing up, because it hurt.
She told me this is a bad sign, it means something is wrong. I told her that it always hurts and causes mild bleeding for me, ever since my first exam at age 15 (I‚Äôm 30)
She said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs very odd‚Äù
And then she couldn‚Äôt get the speculum out!!! She kept tugging at it and saying ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs odd your body just sucked this up there‚Äù
She kept telling me to relax (which in this circumstance triggered me) and I had a panic attack and it did not help.
I was so embarrassed by the whole thing. 
When I got home I checked her medical notes and she wrote I have ‚Äúvaginal pain‚Äù‚Äî I don‚Äôt but it does hurt when my cervix is poked. She alluded to me having vaginismus, which I‚Äôve never had, just her fucking appointment traumatized me.

long story short i had unprotected sex with a rando in late september, and from october to february i had non stop BV and yeast infections back to back to back. every time i‚Äôd do antibiotics, the yeast would get worse, & every time i‚Äôd do antifungals, the BV would get worse. finally i went to my doctor and she prescribed me what she calls the ‚ÄúBomb‚Äù LOL. here‚Äôs her exact words:

Metronidazole by mouth for 2 weeks and boric acid 600mg suppositories (Azo brand) at night before bed for 3 weeks.

i followed this to a T. also:
- i took a vaginal probiotic once a day with 25 billion CFUs (at least 2 hours after antibiotics) 
- i only had protected sex with my boyfriend so i wouldn‚Äôt get any more bad bacteria
- i changed my body wash to a ‚Äúfeminine wash‚Äù that was unscented 
- showered immediately after workouts because in the past i‚Äôve been bad at that
- wore non-thong underwear most of the time

one week after i finished my antibiotics and finished my boric acid prescription, the BV was GONEEEEE. completely. i almost cried i was so happy. and my doc told me it should stay gone as long as i put in a boric acid after every period and after every time i have sex. every time i feel a little itch during the day i use a boric acid just in case (once a week or so, i‚Äôm overly paranoid lol). and i‚Äôm still taking the probiotics each day. it‚Äôs been almost 2 months and i have had ZERO odor üòç

zsapqq,WomensHealth,1671679363.0,"I, 28f, recently decided I should get tested for PCOS, thyroid and other health issues once a friend told me that I had all of the symptoms of PCOS and struggle to lose weight. My friend recommended a few doctors (one being an obgyn). I decided to make an appointment but the main doctor was booked out for around 4 months, however, her PA was available the same day. I accepted the appointment and showed up at the office. Let me start off by saying, that I am in no way religious. I think religion and medicine should be completely separate, but am wholly accepting of whatever anyone wants to be. I did not know until I was taken to an exam room that it would be surrounded by religion (Christian music playing in the background, painting of Jesus on the walls, anti-abortion stickers, etc). As a non-religious person, and with an anyone-can-do-whatever-they-want-as-long-as-they‚Äôre-not-hurting-anyone mentality, I was a little taken aback. Anywho, I meet with the PA and she starts asking questions about my sexual history. Am I sexually active? Ever had an STD? How many partners I‚Äôve had? Once I disclose how many partners I‚Äôve had (which is less than 25, more than 10), she proceeds to say ‚Äúwe‚Äôll have to talk about chastity.‚Äù I laughed because I thought it was a joke and said ‚Äúlike, abstaining from sex? Why on earth would I do that? Especially if I‚Äôm safe about it and use protection?‚Äù She didn‚Äôt give an answer and I firmly told her that I had zero interest in talking about chastity or anything else similar to the topic. At the end of my visit she said ‚Äúsee? I didn‚Äôt talk about chastity.‚Äù
As someone who is super open about life/experiences/issues/etc, especially when it comes to a medical professional, am I the only one who finds this to be just completely strange? 
At one point (with a whole lot of Jesus‚Äô staring at me), I asked if I needed to be religious to attend this practice and she said ‚Äúno! Of course not. We cater to all types.‚Äù 
Anyway, my question is, was mentioning chastity a normal line of questioning? After doing some more deep diving, I found out the practice is very rooted in catholic religion, with most folks saying the doctors prayed with them after the visit. 
Obviously, this isn‚Äôt a good fit for me, but is there anything unethical or wrong about judging me for how many people I‚Äôve slept with/mentioning something religious during a visit? It certainly seemed like she was judging the number of people I‚Äôve slept with. 
Or am I in the wrong because for all intents and purposes, this was a practice with deep religious beliefs, and I didn‚Äôt know? To be honest, I wasn‚Äôt even aware a medical practice could have such blatant beliefs.

My period had sort of tapered off for a couple of months which worried me but I assumed it was due to stress. I got my period back but the pain was intense causing me to stay at home for days on end. Suddenly, I was experiencing the same pain but outside of my actual period which lead me to believe I was PMSing. Two days later, no joke, I am curled on the ground unable to move, sobbing my eyes out in the worse pain imaginable. Like the most intense pain I've ever experienced. This all happened after I was sent away from my clinic three times with some Advil and a hot pack. 

Went to the ER and after an ultrasound, they told me I had two gigantic cysts twisting my ovary. Some ovarian cysts resolve on their own but dermoid cysts, like the ones I had, had to be surgically removed. Some surgeries to remove these cysts are less invasive than others but ultimately I was left with a C-section-like scar.

As someone with PCOS who gets a host of issues during my period (the worst of which being a weakened immune system), I discovered there was actually no reason to put myself through it because my birth control allowed it

First of all, the ‚Äúperiod‚Äù you get from birth control pills is actually withdrawal bleeding. It is not the same as a natural menstrual cycle, and rather an artificial simulation of a period (and therefore NOT medically necessary).

We've been together for about a year now and things are great expect for the smell of her vagina. I'll be the first to admit that I don't know a ton about how the vagina works or what it's supposed to smell like (I've had no other partners) but her scent doesn't seem normal. On a good day, it'll smell a bit like strong onion-y BO but on a bad day.... I don't know how to describe it other than poop. It smells like if I stuck my face in someone's butt and they didn't wipe well. 

At first I thought it was maybe her hygiene after a trip to the bathroom needed improvement but I've been back there and it's fine. I notice the smell the most after my fingers are on or in her and it can be a bit hard at times to be excited to perform oral sex on her. The smell also lingers on my fingers sometimes after a wash. I'm also starting to get concerned that something is wrong and she may need to see a doctor.

I have yet to bring it up because I can usually just power through and if something was up surely she would know before me but now I'm realizing that I'm just putting myself in a worse position by not. I'm starting to at times not want to be physically intimate with her because of it and the longer I don't say something I think the chance of hurt grows exponentially (something I wish I had realized earlier but nothing I can do about that now).

So I guess my question is, how can I bring this up? Should I bring it up? Should I mention that I've done internet research and point her to resources?

1872t5a,Healthyhooha,1701298966.0,"I (21f) recently had my annual check up with my doctor and she informed me that if I want to have children in the future I will need to stop taking my hormonal birth control pills by next year. Next year would be my 5th consecutive year of taking birth control. 

I‚Äôm somewhat concerned about other birth control methods such as condoms and stuff but my biggest concern is my periods. 

The reason I got on birth control is because I had extremely heavy and painful periods that would cause me to overheat, get tunnel vision, go blind, and faint (in that order). The only other way to prevent this is to lay on the cold floor and not stand up while it‚Äôs happening. 

Not only is it painful and scary to be fainting and going blind, but this also interferes with my ability to work every time I‚Äôm on my period. 

I‚Äôve tried to get help from doctors about this before and have gotten a ton of tests done but everything comes back normal and birth control has been the only thing preventing this from happening. I don‚Äôt want to lose my ability to have children but I don‚Äôt know if I can handle the fainting and everything else that comes with it.

I‚Äôm not even sure where to start when it comes for asking for advice on what to do about this.

EDIT:
Thank you guys all for your responses. The general consensus seems to be that my doctor is either dumb or lying and I need to seek out a second opinion which I plan to do. 

I also have a lot of people bringing up Endometriosis and some other things to get tested for. I am rather sure that the reason I am fainting is because of Vasovagal Syncope. This isn‚Äôt directly related to my period pain but I think it‚Äôs what‚Äôs causing me to lose consciousness. That of course doesn‚Äôt address the source of my pain though. 
I will be sure to ask about Endo when I seek out a second opinion but I won‚Äôt deny I‚Äôm incredibly hesitant to get more testing done after the last time.

One of the studies \[[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3682672/)\] reported that a ‚Äúmajority‚Äù (62%) of women say insertion is about as painful as menstruation. This was not comforting to me because some people (myself included), have *very* painful periods. I pushed for a paracervical block and anti-anxiety medication when I had my IUD placed. I felt nothing and 100% would insist my doctor give me both again. 

I see questions about IUD insertion/pain at least once a week on this sub. And there are always at least a few comments saying, ‚ÄúYeah, it hurts soooo bad, but you will be ok.‚Äù 

**Let‚Äôs not say that.** 

If you are the lucky person who had an easy and (relatively) painless IUD insertion, I am happy for you. Or if you are just the the type to grin and bear it, I am a little in awe of you. But let's be honest, how many of us have heard IUD insertion is a walk in the park? And just because women have the fortitude to give birth doesn't mean we have to be ‚Äúok‚Äù with uterine pain in general. 

**TL;DR** will getting an IUD hurt? Most likely, but it doesn‚Äôt have to. You can and should share any concerns with your doctor. Ask about pain and anxiety reducing options that are safe and affordable for you. A good physician will work with you. If they push back, use a few legitimate studies to back up your argument (or look for a doctor who is more receptive to your needs).

I have been feeling really numb the past month. I don't know how to feel about the results of my own trial. I have had small moments of defeat, anger, frustration, but no strong emotions, which is weird for me because it's been a really difficult 2 years since he was charged. I have felt defeated in regards to women coming forward about the abuse and sexual violence they experience, and the law not doing anything about it. 

I remember feeling so shocked and grateful that I was even believed when I went to the police, and confounded when he was charged. It felt like the system was working. People were actually listening to me. They believed me. After a horrible relationship with this 'man' I left it assuming all responsibility for the abuse I experienced. It was incredibly validating that the legal system that almost always fails women and victims in this scenario was doing it's job. 

Over the course of the investigation and trial I came to largely regret ever going to the police. I try not to, but I am left with the feeling: ""For what?"" Being cross-examined and painted as the person responsible for my abuse by his lawyer was one of the most dehumanizing experiences of my life. Having to discuss the most intimate, traumatizing experiences of my life in front of a room of strangers was one of the most numbing, surreal, and humiliating experiences of my life. 

And for what?

I am left feeling like I can relate to no one. Aside from this horrible relationship, my life has unfortunately been marked with many traumatic events, and I just feel like I can't function as a normal adult as a result. I'm unemployed right now and am terrified of applying anywhere. I have become somewhat paranoid of meeting any new people ever for fear that they will be manipulative and/or abusive. Similarly to my abusive parents, bosses, friends, and intimate partners I've had. I have a good support network, and trusted people in my life that know about what I've been through. I have been talking to multiple counsellors over the past 2 years. But I still find myself feeling overly numb and unable to relate to people. 

I know I'm probably depressed, but the day-to-day is easier to handle if I use methods of distraction, and if I just try to ignore what's going on in my head. I have spent so much time and energy over the past couple years healing and understanding the things I've experienced, and often lately I feel like I'm talked out. I wish I could just move on, forget about it, and never think about it again. But more than that I wish it never happened. 

My abuser gets to walk around the world free from any consequences and I have to live C-PTSD, fear of intimacy, broken trust in others, fear of men, etc. I just don't know where to go from here.

kzaucg,Healthyhooha,1610905109.0,"For the past 3 years I have felt off. I had repeated bacterial vaginitis, yeast infections, and extremely painful pelvic pain. No doctor was ever able to tell me what was wrong, and why I had repeated infection and pain. All doctors attributed my pelvic pain to my IUD. I have many friends with them and they never had pelvic pain for more than a month after insertion, mine persisted for years. I also bled after sex, but was negative for all typical std‚Äôs that the OBGYN typically test for. The doctors will make you feel crazy, and belittle your problems, so beware of that and fight for yourself, you are your biggest advocate and don‚Äôt back down especially when it comes to your health! I eventually saw a specialist that prescribed me boric acid suppositories to insert for two weeks for my vaginal infections, and felt instant relief. But it turns out that relief was only a bandaid to an even bigger problem and that relief lasted for a short time. 

Fast forward to September 2020, and I started to develop UTI symptoms: urinary frequency, urgency, bladder pain, feeling like I wasn‚Äôt emptying, etc. i was having urinary symptoms on top of pelvic pain, and vaginal infections. I went to the doctor once a week for a month and all my testing came back negative for UTI‚Äôs, my doctors were at a loss of what was wrong. I had this UTI pain for almost 2 months it was AWFUL. It was really starting to affect my life, I wasn‚Äôt sleeping and I was very anxious. 

I had to advocate like heck for myself, I refused to back down because I knew something was really wrong. I found a doctor that was willing to order a microgen dx urinary and vaginal test. Turns out I was positive for ureaplasma parvum. I had a naturopath try to prescribe me natural things, so I ditched that doctor and had my primary care treat me for this. Find a doctor that you trust, and that is willing to work with you and not discount any of your questions or concerns. That is the hardest part is finding a good doctor. I went to at least 6 different OBGYN‚Äôs over the years, but none of them were willing to listen to me or think outside the box. My primary care immediately knew what ureaplasma was, and prescribed me 21 days of doxycycline to take twice a day and my partner took the same exact course which is crucial. My partner had absolutely zero symptoms but even if they do they should still be treated. No sex, no contact, no oral sex until you get retested again. My symptoms have completely disappeared after taking the full 21 days of doxycycline. I avoided dairy for 2 hours before and 2 hours after bc it affects the absorption of the antibiotic. It does cause serious nausea so do eat with some type of food in your stomach if you are prone to nausea. My primary care also ordered a CT of my kidneys bc I was having back pain, and it turns out I have unrelated gi issues as well, and a huge distention that the dr‚Äôs think could have contributed to urinary frequency. The dr‚Äôs still think most of the issues were caused by ureplasma, but some of that pain could‚Äôve been my gi issues as well. So get a doctor that is willing to explore all avenues, bc it may not be just the ureaplasma. I am now being properly treated for all of my health issues finally!


I am not here to give medical advice or tell you what to do, I am simply just telling you my story and hoping that this gives you some kind of hope. There is a lot of negativity on the internet regarding this bacteria. You never know how some people live their life, especially the people that have symptoms that never go away. You don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre engaging in sex with someone who has the infection, or if they didn‚Äôt finish the full course of antibiotics, etc. Don‚Äôt believe everything you hear on the internet. I hope my story can help at least one person out there! I believe the only reason I got through this infection was finding the right doctor to work with me and take me seriously. Take your antibiotics, abstain from sex until you and whoever you have sex with is negative, and then you‚Äôre free from this! I know lots of people have lingering symptoms, it may take 6 months plus to be completely symptom free, but if your test is negative and you still have some lingering pain, keep following with your doctor, it is not uncommon. I have twinges of urinary pain that last 30 minutes or so every few weeks, but it is nothing like the pain I felt every day when I was suffering with this.

yabv1n,WomensHealth,1666406157.0,"TW: sexual misconduct 

I (22F) spent a solid 12 hours in the ER 2 weekends ago. I was traveling with my boyfriend in an unfamiliar part of the country and we thought I had appendicitis. We went to the nearest decent hospital. 

Anyways, after many tests, it turns out I had an ovarian cyst that ruptured and caused significant internal bleeding in my abdomen. The ER staff called in an ultrasound tech and 2 doctors (OBGYNs) from a sister hospital. One doctor was a man (approx 30 years old) and one was a woman (slightly older than him).

For some reason, it was decided that the male doctor would do an internal pelvic exam. I definitely would have preferred the female doctor for this but I didn‚Äôt get a say. 

I (very stupidly) had my boyfriend leave the room because I didn‚Äôt know if he was allowed to stay and I worried he would be uncomfortable seeing me in pain and in such a vulnerable state etc. Then the doctor tells me to get undressed from the waist down, but doesn‚Äôt give me a gown or a sheet. So I was just naked from the waist down trying to cover myself with my sweatshirt when he and the nurse came back into the room. He apologized for this.

The male doctor and female nurse used the speculum and that seemed normal, however he then proceeded to stick his fingers inside me for several minutes with NO GLOVES. He was narrating this a little at first saying ‚Äúokay two fingers coming in‚Ä¶ oh actually only one!‚Äù kind of laughing, I‚Äôm assuming because I was very tight. I was really embarrassed and uncomfortable because it didn‚Äôt feel much different from being fingered in a sexual way (besides the extreme abdominal pain and psychological distress). 

I didn‚Äôt say anything to him in the moment. I decided to push it into the back of my mind until today, when I had a follow up with a trusted female OBGYN in my home city. My exam with her felt very different and more professional. I told her what happened in the ER and she was shocked and seemed kind of horrified about him not wearing gloves.

After hearing her perspective I decided to call a patient advocacy line and make a report. The woman on the phone was also deeply concerned. She said they would inform his supervisors and investigate immediately. I requested anonymity and she agreed. She kept asking me if I‚Äôm okay and I told her I don‚Äôt know. 

I just don‚Äôt know how to process this. He could have made an honest mistake, or he could have intentionally taken advantage of my extremely vulnerable state and sexually violated me. And I‚Äôll probably never know which one. 

I don‚Äôt know if this is even relevant, but I am a ‚Äúconventionally attractive‚Äù 22 year old girl and I work part time as a model. I have had a lot of experiences with unwanted and inappropriate sexual attention from men and so maybe I am paranoid and overly sensitive.

I'm just going to talk about some of the stuff I read, please correct anything you see that you think is wrong or that you believe I misinterpreted.

First question: is there a difference between a period and a menstrual cycle?

I kept reading about a menstrual cycle of some kind which supposedly lasts \~4 weeks, with a decent amount of variation, but I also an article which stated that the actual flushing of the membranes, the bleeding part, lasts for about 2 to 7 days? Is this true? And if so, is it just a very small amount of blood that just slowly exits the body over this period of time? And does the word ""period"" refer to menstruation or the entire cycle?

I also read about how these menstrual cycles sometimes don't occur, and sometimes skips a month. Prior to this I always thought menstrual cycles were this kind of endless cycle that just doesn't stop until you lose fertility, but are there days when you're not in any stage of the menstrual cycle at all, other than when you're pre-pubescent/no longer fertile?

Thanks.

Edit: Do women use tampons for the entire length of menstruation, switching every so often, or are there times when a tampon isn't used (i.e. when sleeping, or something, idk).

13u9bml,Healthyhooha,1685303325.0,"I‚Äôm not sure where I can talk about this throughly once again, I have posted about it before but now I really feel like if I wrote about it and get others insight it would help me out.

I‚Äôm 26 female and I haven‚Äôt gotten the HPV vaccine. It came out when I was around 11 I think, so my mom refused it back then. Fast forward of my dad losing his job, family not having health insurance to go to the doctor followed by me going off to college and then Covid closing everything, I‚Äôm now on Medicaid and I guess I have the opportunity to get the vaccine or so until I turn 27 just to have to be covered by Medicaid.

I‚Äôm not sexually active and never have been due to personal reasons. As I mentioned in a previous post my obgyn and my now nurse practitioner that I just saw, highly encouraged me to get it or looked into it more. I felt like my nurse practitioner was REALLY trying to talk me into it. Heck I almost did the vaccine at her office but then chicken out at the last second saying that I need to think about doing so more.

I‚Äôm torn because growing up, my mother would talk about how the vaccine has lawsuits, of people getting autoimmune diseases from it, and even now how it does. My mom isn‚Äôt anti-vaxx, heck this is the only vaccine that I think I don‚Äôt have, but she has this belief and thinks that it‚Äôs stupid for me to get since I‚Äôm not sexually active or even have a boyfriend. I think now that I‚Äôm older she just keeps telling me that it‚Äôs up for me to decide. I want to protect myself, in case that day magically come as I don‚Äôt have control on what my partner has done or if they would knowingly have it, or heck if I get it from sexual assault if that happens to me (I‚Äôve read stories on how others got hpv from sexual assault and sadly been commented on in the past that i‚Äôll probably be sexually assaulted)

I‚Äôm also scared on how I would react to the vaccine as since I‚Äôve had Covid a year ago I haven‚Äôt been reacting to other vaccines that well. I had a tdap booster when I went to my last appointment and well, I had a stomachache and diarrhea for a day or so and my mom called me a whimp for having side effects to a shot. I feel like Covid really effected my immune system even a year later, and i‚Äôm scared for the future on that.

My nurse practitioner was also really encouraged it since again i‚Äôm 26 and supposedly Medicaid won‚Äôt cover all of the shots once I turn 27. So I guess I‚Äôm short on time as I would be able to get two shots at least, before I turn 27 depending on if I get an appointment in the next two months. 

I want to get it due to the comments from my doctors, my friends who have gotten the vaccine now it‚Äôs their 20s, and even stuff like the news encouraging others to get it, but again I have the fear of how will I react to it and the unknown of how it‚Äôll effect me in any way.

I guess I want some others thoughts or even wondering am I the only one who thinks this so much.

xvxf45,Healthyhooha,1664935082.0,"Yep..I'm certain I had bv years. I feel so embarrassed and awful that my past partners and current partner dealt with it. Although no one has ever said anything to me about it, I'm sure that it was noticeable during sex. Sadly, I'm only now getting a better grip on keeping up with my health by seeing doctors at 25. It feels like a milestone to be at a place now where I have a PCP, prescriptions, diagnoses etc. 

After years of abnormal (in my mind normal) discharge and vaginal odor, I finally went to a doctor to get swabbed. The smell got stronger over time and was an almost sour, sometimes slightly fishy smell. I think I was so used to it that it wasn't off putting to me, but I knew it was there. I also had a persistent itch, specifically on my mons pubis area that indicated an issue. I thought was due to dry skin or shaving/trimming. 

Once the results came back confirming it was bv, I was prescribed oral metronidazole twice daily for 7 days. Just after the first day, I noticed the smell I once thought was normal was gone! I was so shocked. It was so bizarre to not smell anything. 

Since completing the week of metro, I no longer have an odor or excessive discharge. I still get itchy on my mons, but not as irritating as before. The lesson learned is that if you notice a smell, go see a doctor right away! Even if you have a slight suspicion or doubt. 

I'm very much embarrassed and honestly sad to realize I was not taking care of myself for so long. But I'm here now, and will do better about checking on my hooha health.

wzdh01,Healthyhooha,1661634236.0,"I haven‚Äôt had a UTI in a long time up until two and a half weeks ago. About five years ago, I was in a long distance relationship and the first time my partner and I would have sex after not seeing each other for an extended period, I was prone to getting them and they would totally disable me. The sight of blood in my pee alone would make me seriously nauseous and that was far from the worst part. 

Fast forward and I‚Äôve been with my current partner for almost two years and I had never gotten a UTI from sleeping with him. Then, a month ago, he and I both got Covid at the same time. We were really sick for about ten days and the after effects are still lingering in terms of fatigue but we are generally recovering. 

However, two weeks ago, the morning after sleeping with my boyfriend, I awoke with an unwelcome, familiar feeling. Within a few hours, I was peeing blood and was in agony. Such a specific, horrible agony that‚Äôs really difficult to describe. Having just moved abroad and not yet having medical insurance in my new country, my boyfriend‚Äôs mother went out of her way to get me a prescription to treat it and after hearing about how much I was suffering (like crying in pain), his mother also managed to get a prescription for codeine tablets (10, 20mg pills). These SAVED me. 

Once again, this morning, I woke up nauseous and knew almost right away what was in store. I went to the toilet, smelled the familiar smell but didn‚Äôt see blood until later in the day. I had a low grade fever and wanted to scream! 

This time, my SO found a bottle of unused doxycycline in his medicine cabinet but the OTC pain meds just weren‚Äôt doing me any good. My boyfriend happens to have many close friends who are doctors and one very kind acquaintance helped by coming to our flat, confirming I was in pain, and prescribed the same codeine tablets. Once again, they are saving me from literally sobbing and writhing to pain. 

Firstly, I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs plausible that my recent Covid infection might have left my immune system weak and more susceptible to UTIs? But mostly, I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm alone in thinking UTI pain is wildly under-treated and women are just expected to suffer through it for a few days while we wait for the antibiotics to work? 

I seriously don‚Äôt consider it mild pain and think a mild opiate like codeine in low doses and without refills is a totally fitting medication for the level of pain and discomfort. However, in the US, I‚Äôve never been offered anything prescription strength for the pain, only now that I‚Äôm abroad in a country with national healthcare am I given something that actually helps. Maybe it‚Äôs a matter of the opioid crisis in the US but man, UTIs require way more than Tylenol IMO.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/wzdh01/is_uti_pain_way_downplayedundertreated_in_the/,Is UTI pain way downplayed/under-treated in the medical field or am I just very sensitive?,Sexual Health ,116,87,0.99,seriouslydavka

o8btyl,Healthyhooha,1624717703.0,"This is very graphic and was one of the most difficult and shocking things to deal with. Usually, I am pretty on top of my hygiene down there, I'd wash daily and even several times in the shower/bath, use baby wipes, a shower head ect. Well, at least I thought I was on top of my hygiene. Anyway, I have a very small clitoris which is almost completely covered by my clitoral hood but I noticed a small stinging pain when touching the clitoris directly. To make it worse, I tried simulating the clitoris with small makeup brushes (Seriously, don't ask! Just wanted to try something new and copied some masturvation porn videos) and it hurt like hell and stopped. 

A few days later I just decided to examine myself down there and see what my actual clitoris looked like... then bam, I see several white bumps on there under the hood, some which looked almost glued on there. I googled it and was convinced that I had growths and then went down this rabbit hole and convinced myself that it was cancer. I had salt baths and still they wouldn't come off so I was convinced that I had lumps attached on the clitoris itself. Then, I called my doctor and they said its likely due to secretions and build up... they turned out to be right (I'll get to that later). Because of the soreness I was trying to figure out whether it was a sore, blister, pimple ect...

I was convinced that it went down as the spots/pimples/lumps looked less visible. Then checked again and pulled the clit hood further and there were a lot more... And to make it worse, I saw a thick public hair sticking out right under the hood at the top where there is an ultra tiny gap/hole right on top of the clitoris. At that point, I was convinced I had hair growing from there and that the ""spots"" were due to an ingrown and freaked out. Called my doctor again about the hair and she said to use warm water/a warm compress and that as long as it is not getting bigger or causing infection, it should be fine. I went from thinking that I was going to lose my clitoris due to cancer or this ""ingrown hair"". 

I thought I'd have to go to the doctor or nurse to have this hair removed so I had to do what I can to remove it...
I attempt again then the tiny bumps suddenly fell off and were white and solid... turns out it was a build up of smegma (Yuck, I know!).  So I gently cleaned the area with a baby wipe and got one of those thin tweezers to remove the hair poking out of that gap/hole on top of under the clit hood. It took ages and a ton of stretching to get it out, it was incredibly painful! It turned out to be 1 pubic hair from when I was shaving at several other bristles from what do ya know, the brush... 

My clit is now irritated but everything is clean. But I'm incredibly worried about the same happening again!

Anyway, the moral of the story is to pull the hood back FULLY! Because just looking at my vagina normally, everything looked fine. Even when I thought I pulled the hood back fully, I didn't notice the hairs stuck until later. So if you want to keep that area clean, make sure to pull it back as much as possible! 

Oh, and don't put brushes down there LMAO! 

I hope this helps and any advice on how to avoid this in future would be appreciated. Especially since the hood covers everything and due to the hole/gap right on top of the clitoris. I'm still shuddering over this experience but I'm thankful it wasn't anything serious!

I‚Äôd say part of it is that I‚Äôm a light sleeper and so snoring or movement from him prevent me from falling asleep or easily wake me up.  The other part is this almost ‚Äúsleep anxiety‚Äù.  I‚Äôll be lying in bed with him and I‚Äôll get these thoughts ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you just head to the couch now?  You know you won‚Äôt be able to fall asleep here.  Every minute you‚Äôre here is wasting time you could be sleeping‚Äù.

I‚Äôve tried breathing exercises.  I‚Äôve also tried Benadryl and NyQuil (I know, not the healthiest way to form this behavior).  My boyfriend and I don‚Äôt live together so we‚Äôre only sleeping in the same bed 2-3 times a week.  

I feel badly that he wakes up in the morning and I‚Äôm gone, down sleeping in the couch.  I also think it would be so nice to wake up next to him, but that‚Äôs a rare occurrence.

ismtwc,Healthyhooha,1600096604.0,"Tldr: Doctor making questionable choices that appeared to exacerbate the problem. I complain about fears of never having penetrative sex again.

...

I got my first yeast infection after a bubble bath on August 7th. The urgent care I went to did not examine me or culture the discharge. I was prescribed Fluconazole and took both doses as prescribed along with Monistat 3. My symptoms were cured-like white basically odorless discharge with itching and pain up into my vaginal cavity and some itching on my vulva. My symptoms lessened significantly with treatment, so I tried sex, but penetrative sex felt like ripping and burning inside of my vagina and especially on the back part of the entrance of my vagina. 

After having sex this one time, the itching increased and the same discharge returned. I went to my primary care doctor, but had already begun monistat 3 by the time my appointment rolled around. I believe I was on day three of that treatment so when they tested my blood and discharge, they couldn't find a bacteria, yeast, or STIs. The doctor said that this was most likely because the monistat treatment had worked. I wish I would have known not to use the monistat before going into the doctor. It seems like common sense right now, but the untreated symptoms are pretty unbearable. 

The doctor did not prescribe anything after that appointment and said to call back if symptoms came back or worsened. (At the time of the appointment, my symptoms were being well managed by the monistat.)

A couple days later, I attempted to have sex again and found it to be extremely painful just like the previous time. However, the next morning I did not get the weird discharge. The only concerning symptom that had gone worse was the burning pain inside of my vagina that I largely was not aware of outside of penetration. I then called the doctor's office and they got back to me with a prescription for amoxicillin (antibiotic) to treat BV. I was not happy with this prescription. The first half of this year I have suffered from UTIs over and over again and took antibiotics each time and never had a yeast infection as a result of the antibiotics. However, I had read that antibiotics can trigger yeast infections and because my vagina was so messed up, I was really wary of taking the antibiotics. But, to rule out BV, I started a 7-day treatment of the amoxicillin and within a day I had a full-blown yeast infection again. 

This time, I treated the yeast infection with monistat 7. I also emailed my provider back who was on vacation so it got routed to a different provider who said that I could take the amoxicillin, the monistat 7, and Fluconazole concurrently. As with the times before, my symptoms improved with the antifungal medications with the exception of pain in my vaginal cavity. I have also had milky pink spotting throughout this.

The day before last, I completed my amoxicillin treatment and yesterday was my last night of monistat 7 treatment. Today I take the second dose of Fluconazole.

Here is the part where I start hopelessly complaining. I am deeply in love with my partner and sex is a huge part of that connection. Previous to this, our natural 3 year cadence is sex at least every other day. This is so difficult for me emotionally and I don't know when it will end. I miss intimacy with my partner so much. It would be unthinkable for him to pressure me to have sex while I'm in pain so I feel supported through this, but also worried for the long-term effects on my relationship.

Has anybody had anything like this saga and were you able to have penetrative sex again? What are people's experiences with pain in their vaginal cavity after a yeast infection treatment? 

I want to have hope that things can heal and go back to normal.

f5tzso,Healthyhooha,1582041966.0,"I wanted to post my story only because I haven't seen much about this on this page, and I went through 2 years of this before I got an answer.

A little over 2 years ago, a ton of things in my life all changed at once. Also during this time, I started feeling a slight itch, only on the left side of my vulva. Nothing too bad, but enough for me to notice it. I then got a bartholin cyst on that side, which went away after a few sitz baths and was gone by the time my gyno appt came around.

I went to the appt anyways about the slight itch and was told I tested positive for BV, and was given antibiotics. She also told me to get some cortizone cream to help with the itching. Not only did the itch get worse after the antibiotics, I now had a bunch of tiny bumps forming, still only on the left side of my vulva. So I head back to the gyno.

I'm told the bumps are harmless cysts, and I am still testing positive for BV. I also have internal cysts so I have not one, but 2, biopsies done on my cervix. I am given more antibiotics and sent home.

Biopsies all come back normal, but I am still testing positive for BV. The itch has gotten worse, but the doctor can't see anything wrong where it itches. The cysts don't itch, they just surround the itchy patch. It also started becoming painful down there, like I couldn't sit on hard surfaces for long periods of time.

She offers to do a biopsy of the itchy area even though there is nothing there and I say yes. She numbs me up and takes a piece and sends me home. (FYI, the itching did NOT stop when she numbed me, I was hoping for that!) After a day or so of healing, I take a look and she didn't even take a piece from the itchy area! I am mad. She then refers me to a specialty clinic in the next state over stating it could be nerve related.

4 months later my appointment date finally comes. The itching is crazy by now, I cannot sit for more than 10 or 15 minutes due to the pain. Right away at the new appointment, they can see what is wrong. It had gotten bad enough that my skin was starting to change color. Lichen Simplex Chronicus. Caused by stress. Who even knew something like that could happen down there! I now have a strong steroid cream I have to use every night, and a zinc cream I have to use everyday for the next 6 months and HOPE that it heals my skin. The cysts are permanent. I can have them surgically removed, but more than likely they will come back. And then preventative care for the rest of my life. This was caused by stress and can happen again anytime.

Since the very first day I started the prescription steroid cream, the itching has stopped! It's been a week now and things are finally starting to go in a positive direction. It's still painful because that skin is healing, but it doesn't itch! I am now in the market for a new gyno, and wanted to share my story so maybe someone else doesn't have to suffer as long as I had to. Please don't be afraid to push your doctor for results!

EDIT: The specialty clinic said I did NOT have BV, and probably never did. My original doctor was probably using the test strips which are not accurate!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/f5tzso/lichen_simplex_chronicus_keep_pushing_until_you/,lichen simplex chronicus - Keep pushing until you get a diagnosis!,,116,29,0.99,earthspirit1147
9vdjmi,Healthyhooha,1541708403.0,"First of all, I'd like to thank everyone that's been following my story. I'm glad it's entertaining some of you, and hopefully also encouraging anyone to get checked as early as possible if you're having weird symptoms, or to not give up on your journey towards a healthy hooha. 

[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/9v28k1/my_long_ass_hooha_story_part_1_the_time_an/) [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/9v3snb/my_longass_hooha_story_part_2_inflammatory_pelvic/) [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/9vc1g6/my_longass_hooha_story_part_3/)

The Genetics doctor confirmed my diagnosis for Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlich. I was supposed to make an appointment for a different day, but he took one look at my chart and I guess he didn't want to pass up on the opportunity to examine me since he prompted me to go in right away. He explained how the syndrome is formed:

Basically, when we are born, groups of cells form and they later become the respiratory system, and the circulatory system, and so on and so forth. The group of cells that became my reproductive system mutated somewhere along the way, causing my left kidney to either not form at all, or it was so small and useless the body reabsorbed it. It also caused my uterus to not form properly. In the beginning, the two cavities get together to form one big cavity, but in my case the cavities never got smashed properly, so that's how I ended with 2 cavities instead of one. Both cavities were separated by a septum. What I would later discover was that I had yet another septum across the left cavity which didn't allow the period blood to drain properly. The blood would go back up the hooha and develop the stupid blood sacks. If enough time passed, those sacks would get infected, hence all those abscesses. 

I was supposed to get a histeroscopy at that same hospital, but their histeroscope was broken and didn't know when it would get fixed. They recommended another hospital, and that's how we arrive to 2018.

It was 7 months of consultations and tests, including my first ever MRI, which was horrible, I don't recommend it. Anyhow, the doctors finally gave me a day for my surgery and expalined what would be happening. First, I was warned that there would be an audience. My case was just too rare not to witness, apparently. Second, they told me they'd get rid of the septum on the left cavity and if possible, the one in the middle of both cavities. 

Sidenote: If you remember my last ""emergency"" surgery when I got dumped with the women in childbirth and left me to die all night...the same sort of happened this time. I got wheeled down, prepped, and then dumped into an empty OR for HOURS. Doctors and nurses would come in and be like ""What are you doing here?"" And I'd be like ""WHAT THE FUCK DOES IT LOOK LIKE I'M DOING HERE"". They were backed up apparently, but I did finally got what I'm hoping is my last surgery. It was laser and there weren't many complications...other than all the blood I lost, but I didn't need a transfusion or anything. No, it was more fun than that. I had around 6 pieces of gauze balled up in my hooha! 

The next day I got my discharge and was told I'd be bleeding for like 2 weeks. The doctor removed the gauze, and FUCK DID THAT HURT. She inserted two more pieces cause I was still bleeding out a lot; she told me to lie down for a bit and then sit up and eat my breakfast. I was worried because I'd be leaving in a couple of hours and the blood would not stop pouring out, so I finally decided to just run into the bathroom and pee out as much of the blood as possible.

Let me tell you that this is the syndrome that keeps on giving. It just never stopped surprising me. I was expecting a fuckton of blood, but I was not expecting motherfuckin' clots that made me feel like I was giving birth to an alien. For the rest of that day I'd be expelling clots of all sizes and needless to say I spent most of it sleeping. It's worth noting that I almost legit passed out as I walked out of the hospital. It was the whole voices distorting in the backround, ringing ears, and dizziness. But after a day of blood clots and another day of getting my bowels to function again, I was able to finally relax as I healed. 

A month later, I can proudly say I'm not bleeding outside of my period and I no longer experience pain on my left side. I can exercise without worrying about smelly discharge messing up my underwear, and I can freely sleep without panties at night. I've gotten my Implanon to hopefully stop my periods or at least make them go by quicker because I am DONE bleeding so much out of my hooha. DONE. I've met a great guy and if all goes right, tonight will be my first time having sex free of blood and pain. I am just...happy. I'm 25 years old and I feel like I can finally start living.

But if I'm being completely honest, I'm mostly looking forward to get pregnant in the future. My future baby: I did it all for you.

we had gone out to get food and drinks, both had about two beer before heading back to the airbnb. we had talked about past friendships and relationships and during the bus ride home he asked me if a relationship was an option between the two of us. he admitted that what he thought to be a passing crush had developed into real love, and that he'd been debating telling me for a while now. i still don't know how long this has been going on, but he's been in love with me for half a year at least. 

i was so uncomfortable. i tried to convey ""no, never"" in the nicest way possible, but still making sure that i was not giving even the tiniest bit of hope. we were in a bus, on the way back to an airbnb, where we were about to sleep in the same bed, and i just pretended everything was alright. that night i googled flights home, didn't book any, and after still feeling very weirded out in the morning i texted my sister and scheduled an emergency phone call with my therapist. i eventually decided to get a hotel room to myself for the rest of the stay because i needed space.

i sat my friend down and let him know that i was leaving and we talked a bit more about his confession as i packed as quickly as possible. essentially he let me know that this had been on his mind for a long time, and he had made his peace with the possibility that a relationship would never work out. he was relieved when i rejected him very clearly, cause that gave him peace of mind.

i on the other hand was pissed because while he had time to come to terms with things, i had been completely surprised with the information. i am currently away from home, away from family, friends, or any other kinds of support, i'm in another country. and he thinks it's a good idea to ask me out while i am trapped with him. at least that got through to him, he cried and apologised for being selfish, but i'm genuinely at my wit's end. i'm fine to do the rest of my vacation alone, but right now i feel like shit (being in a nice hotel and having a hot shower definitely helped tho). how do i handle this friendship now?

The labia are on the outside of your body.
It's just near the vaginas entrance.

We all have them, and they come in all DIFFERENT
- shapes,
- colours,
- and sizes

For years I hated my labia. I was humiliated. I felt ashamed.

It didn't look anything like the ones in porn or magazines. 
Mine looked huge in comparison! I felt like a man. Completely stripped of all of my feminine confidence.

Please see below a link to the labia library... I recommend viewing it in a more private location, given the photos are very natural, very revealing, and very real. But they're beautiful, and more women need to be educated on, and understand what is real, and what is normal.

http://www.labialibrary.org.au/ 

Every woman's vagina is like a blooming garden, and it's about time we each become familiar with our own garden and start to love and embrace it.

It's normal, it's beautiful. 

People love it. No, not everyone will... 
Some people watch too much porn and have an unrealistic expectation of reality, others will have a difference of opinion. The same way we prefer different food, or outfits.

If you love your garden, and be confident in it, it will blossom. The right person will love it for what it is, because it's their garden. And if someone walks in and hates it so much they want to pull it all out and re-landscape, then they can take their business elsewhere!!

I HAVE GOOD NEWS!!!!!   
so after 2 years of battling what I thought was chronic bv, and hours and hours of research, I found cytolytic vaginosis. everything pointed you it so I bought a bunch of baking soda and was gonna start my baths. until I came across a post by someone 7 years ago saying she had my symptoms and was negative for everything but she tried the process of elemination and it turned out to be a yeast infection. She told me she did the 7 day monistat just to rule it out and her vagina has been normal since. So I wanted to rule out any infection before I tried the baths as well and I did the 7 day monistat. After a couple day‚Äôs I still found discharge so I got discouraged and was ready to do my baths. But day by day my discharge was less and less and it was getting more watery instead of thick. So I just monitored it for a week and I HAVE NO MORE DISCHARGE!!! Everything feels and looks normal again!! it still tastes a little sour so I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs still balancing out every day but the discharge is 100% gone. I‚Äôm so happy that the day is Finally here.

This is the first period i have gotten since my birth control has begun, and so far i‚Äôm going on week 3 of my period. Recently, as in just a few days ago and today, i passed a decidual cast. my first thought was that my uterus had fallen out (because i heard that happens) but once i did my research i learned that it could be from my birth control. my mother is a nurse and she told me not to worry about things, and that it‚Äôs just my birth control thining out my uterus lining so that my bleeding can stop quicker, and future periods should be smooth. i‚Äôll attach pictures of my cast below. supposedly it‚Äôs a rare thing, and casts past in one go, well another piece had slipped out while i was at work earlier and i was sure to document it.

I‚Äôve been facing problems with my period for so long that i‚Äôm starting to give up and accept my fate, how i will never be able to normally have sex and how i will somehow always be in pain, i‚Äôll never keep any weight i lose off completely, i‚Äôll always be angry and in a shitty mood, and my bank account will tank a huge toll with all of the pads i have to constantly buy. I thought birth control would help me, and i‚Äôm hoping it does, but i‚Äôm getting discouraged because after you pass a decidual cast, the bleeding and cramps should begin to ease. everything calms down for around an hour and then it‚Äôs right back to terribly painful cramps and heavy bleeding. i‚Äôll have to go back to a doctor and all they‚Äôll do is shove birth control in my face again. does anyone have a solution? or go through something similar? what should i do? the fact that i‚Äôm not even in my 20s yet and i‚Äôm experiencing this just discourages me, i won‚Äôt ever be normal.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14jb5qf,I‚Äôm pretty scared and i‚Äôm getting discouraged (19f),Period Question,115,43,0.98,None

Last week I had a very painful vagina area, felt like a bruise and it hurt to wipe. So I poked around a little and felt a large egg size mass at the opening of my vagina. Ok, google, tell me what it is. Bartholin cyst was the winner. Next day I went to the OB, they confirmed, numbed and lanced it. Two days later, it was back. I waited a few days then went back to the doctor, my worst fear came true, it was back. 

She numbed it and made a larger incision. She said it was bleeding a little and she‚Äôd put some silver nitrate on it to stop it. Ok. I get home and I‚Äôm in excruciating pain, I lay down and take some Advil but I‚Äôm shaking from how bad it hurts and it feels like gushing is happening. 

I stood up and looked in my underwear, a golf ball size clot fell out of me and I was actively bleeding down my legs. We called 911, I go to the hospital and I bleed throw two overnight maxis in an hour with more large clots coming out. 

A few hours and a lot of blood loss later, I get stitches to stop the bleeding. I thought I was dying that‚Äôs how much blood was coming out. 

Has this happened to anyone else? It really messed me up emotionally.

vygg71,WomensHealth,1657752966.0,"I was just wondering what other women had to say about my current predicament and if it's worth bringing up with my doctor.

I have a male GP and I have no problem discussing anything and everything with him. I know that he's a professional. He's especially great for me since I live abroad now and he used to work in the UK (where I'm from), so communication is much easier than previous GPs I've had in this country.

I had a copper IUD placed in the UK a year ago, it was going alright but recently I've been having complications and I need it removed ASAP. I called for an appointment to remove it and asked if it would be possible to have a female doctor as I'd be more comfortable with that. The receptionist started badgering me about why I wanted that. I just repeated that it was something I'd more comfortable with. Eventually she asked ""I don't understand the problem. Did he DO something to you?""... Not sure why the receptionist is being so weirded out and upset about the request and also what a strange thing to ask a patient over the phone but anywayy...

She asked the female GP at the practice and she refused to do it (something about not wanting to be stuck with all his female patients when they require intimate procedures?). I asked if there was any alternative and she said no and told me to find a new doctor or let him remove it.

Well, since I'm having a really rough time with it right now I feel pretty much cornered into letting him remove it and I'm now ten times more uncomfortable with the whole situation. All the phone calls and back and forth felt really confrontational and they were acting like I was insane for even asking.

I'm going to get it removed tomorrow because I'm desperate and I'm wondering if I should mention the whole ordeal with my GP and that I found it quite unprofessional and upsetting.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/vygg71/asked_for_a_female_doctor_and_they_refused_and/,Asked for a female doctor and they refused and badgered me about it,Support/Personal Experience ,114,21,0.97,Layla_Vos

s20c9a,Healthyhooha,1641972267.0,"**Obligatory apology for length. I will also warn that this post includes details of my medical history, specifically vaginal health issues, and mention of SA**



I don't even know where to start.

I  miss not being aware of my genitals, more specifically my vagina. I was  only worried about the aesthetics of my vulva, trimming my pubic hair,  learning new ways to bald myself. I was just trying to make viewing it  pleasant for myself, and potentially a partner in the future.

I  never had any vaginal issues until I was sexually assaulted in October  of 2020. After that I got my first yeast infection, which last 10-14  days. Over a week of the worst, burning, itching, and general discomfort  I've ever experienced in my life. I didn't have insurance at the time,  so I suffered through at-home treatments hoping for something to work.

I  got over it, and everything seemed fine. I slowly became less aware of  my vagina again. In May of 2021 I was contacted by a past partner (who I  was seeing briefly from February to April of 2021), letting me know he  tested positive for chlamydia and that I should also be tested. I tested  positive with no symptoms that seemed related. I had increased urinary  frequency, but I had started drinking 2-3 liters of water a day (double  or triple what I would normally). I had discharge, but nothing alarming  about it, just white discharge with no smell. I was treated, and  retested a month later to confirm treatment was successful. Wonderful.

Fast  forward to September. I had a ONS, and I became increasingly paranoid  of him giving me something (I'll note here that being SA caused me to  lose impulse control, so I have never been good about insisting on  condom usage, I am sterile so pregnancy isn't a concern). I went in a  few weeks later, as I began having a very noticeable smell and milky  discharge. I had a full panel done, as well as a wet-prep to test for  yeast, BV, and trich. BV was the winner. After a course of antibiotics  that sucked the life out of me, I was all better.

Or  so I thought. I was eating better, drinking tons of water, feeling  really good about my vaginal health. I had a new partner starting in  November, and in December developed another yeast infection. This time I  was able to get in with a doctor where I was prescribed diflucan to  treat the YI (had a full panel done again). After about a week and a  half, I felt the infection had cleared up, but I was still having  irritation at the vaginal opening, burning as well with  insertion/penetration (attempted sex, had to stop) and some discharge.  There was no odor.  I was rechecked for yeast, BV, and trich. everything  came back negative and I was told to try boric acid.

Ever  since I have become hyper aware of my vagina. Every slight tingle,  every potential burning or itching sensation, every drop of discharge. I  frantically google what discharge is normal, what may be an infection. I  am not someone who has a history of discharge, aside from during  ovulation where I get a sticky blob of clear discharge when I wipe. I  have become paranoid that no matter what I do I am going to trigger  another infection. I have become scared to engage in PIV in case it is  triggering infections. I smell the toilet paper every time I wipe to  ensure there are no changes. I touch any discharge that is in my  underwear or lingering on toilet paper to assess texture.

I  don't know what to do or how to cope, I don't want to be constantly  thinking about my vagina's existence. Is this what being in a female  body is? I've always said the female body is a trap. It's so nice to  look at, to touch, to feel, but it is so finicky and complicated.

This woman made me wait the first time I had an appointment with her (mandatory to ""counsel"" about getting the IUD) for about half an hour. No apologies, no nothing. I sat in the waiting room wearing a mask during my lunch break for half an hour waiting for her highness to show up. But no big deal. I get it. Healthcare staff is busy, appointments run over, no bother. I understand.

Today was my appointment to get the IUD fitted with her. She only does it during your period. Great. Call 2 weeks ago, sorry, no, she's on vacation until today. Awesome. My periods last 2 weeks anyway so I figure that's grand, get it today then, her first day back.

The taxi cancelled after saying it was on the way. Tried to find another ride. Managed to get one but would be late. Called the clinic letting them know as a courtesy. They said it was probably fine.

2 minutes away from the clinic I get a call saying the nurse had left. She's strictly by appointment only. No warning she'd be leaving, didn't even bother telling me herself. Nothing. The whole drive was completely for nothing. 40 minutes down the drain. 

So to the nurse who has no problem letting her patients wait for her half an hour every day, barely apologising for it and of course never giving any notice and letting you sit in the waiting room during COVID for half an hour:

Go suck a cactus.

I'll just wait another month until her highness deems me worthy of her time. Another month of 2 weeks bleeding, wanting to die. But sure, why wait the way you made me wait you absolute fungi. Especially since I know I'll have to wait for her next time I'll see her! Another day to take off, hoping this time she'll maybe see me (but certainly not on time!)

m2fquo,Healthyhooha,1615429766.0,"This past weekend, I had a colorless under-the-skin bump that had been bothering me. Actually, I think the bump had been forming since earlier that week, maybe around Wednesday. I had shaved a day or two before & assumed it was because of that. 
It wasn‚Äôt until Saturday or Sunday that it started to feel really irritated. It seemed inflamed, but still under the skin. No head, no blister. The same day, I noticed that it hurt to pee but I get UTIs often & my urethra seems to be easily irritated even without infection, so I didn‚Äôt think much of it. I thought it was an ingrown hair, messed with it (bad I know!) & noticed later that it left a tiny ulcer.

Monday, I noticed that I formed two more similar spots, but much smaller. They didn‚Äôt ulcerate, but they did get crusty. Throughout the day, I started feeling like shit. Leg pain, back pain, deep vulva pain/soreness, swollen lymph nodes, flulike symptoms... all of the typical first-outbreak symptoms. 

I recently ordered a full panel including a herpes blood test, so I went ahead & got that done. However, I know that herpes can take up to 6 weeks to show up on a blood test. I did an online appointment to get anti-virals yesterday & scheduled a gyno appointment for today so that I could get it swabbed. I had pretty much already accepted that it was herpes (upsetting, but not the end of the world!), especially since my partner gets frequent cold sores. 

However, because I didn‚Äôt have any blisters, & because the first bump seemed to be an under-the-skin irritation that slowly grew (& it‚Äôs still inflamed underneath the skin), I was worried it might actually be a bacterial infection. I‚Äôve had staph before & know it can cause similar symptoms. This would honestly be scarier than herpes to me because staph can literally eat your skin. My mom told me she got staph on her vulva from shaving before & it also gave her sores & swollen lymph nodes.

Another strange symptom is that my inner labia has been extremely pale throughout this whole thing (I‚Äôve been looking at it with a magnifying mirror like a million times a day). I‚Äôve tried googling this & I haven‚Äôt found anything about herpes causing your entire labia minora to whiten. 

My gyno was in a rush because he had to deliver a baby. I get it, but I would‚Äôve preferred they rescheduled my appointment. He came in, grabbed a speculum, inserted it immediately & very fast (ouch!!!!!!), & said he was doing a Pap smear, chlamydia/gonorrhea test, & that he could tell just from looking that it was herpes. When I started to mention that I had gotten a blood test but wanted to get a swab & be sure, he seemed annoyed. He said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need a swab or even a blood test ‚Äî it is 100% my clinical opinion that this is herpes.‚Äù & that was that. Never mind that I didn‚Äôt need a chlamydia/gonorrhea test, as I had just told them I had gotten a full panel. I didn‚Äôt even have time to explain my symptoms or ask about the discoloration.

It was so rushed, upsetting, & painful, I almost cried. I think he assumed I just couldn‚Äôt accept that I had herpes & was wasting his time asking for a test. I ended up going to the urgent care to get swabbed, where the doctor was much kinder & told me that it didn‚Äôt look like herpes & while it could be, she was going to prescribe antibiotics in case it was a bacterial infection.

k0rxc8,Healthyhooha,1606309902.0,"I turned 30 this year and got a new partner. After about a month, I was plagued with a UTI about 1-2 times in a month. Usually paired with a yeastie from the antibiotics. I spent over $600 in urgent care and video Dr. bills. It was bad. I thought I was allergic to lube, his particular jizz (which one doctor said happens more frequently than expected), underwear, tap water. I tried so many things. But alas, e coli in my uti everytime, which typically means that yes, poop got in the urethra somehow. 

I was taking 9 500mg d mannose a day, cranberry pills and drinking half my weight translated to ounces in water a day. Still got a UTI.

I finally went to a Urinary specialist and they took a direct pee sample through catheter of my bladder. More e coli. 

Basically she told me, stick with the d Mannose and even though you think no poop is getting near there, it is. 

So I finally now have made it to the month mark with no UTI and this is what I started doing...

Before sex, quick wash with unscented soap and water on outside vag and butthole. After sex, pee and same quick wash. 

Everytime I poop, I use unscented baby wipes and toilet paper AND do a quick unscented soap wash if I'm at home. No more thongs, they can move the poop particles, even cotton ones. 

I change my bed sheets now as recommended by the doctor every 3 days. I never re-wear jeans or pajama pants anymore.

Hi everyone. I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôm allowed to do this, and I don‚Äôt even know if anyone would care to read it, but I wanted to let you know what happened after my original post. You were all so supportive and wonderful to me and this isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôve been able to talk to anyone in my real life about, so here goes.

After reading the responses to my post it took me a while to build up the courage to call my local records centre. They told me how to formally request information, and it took a long time to build up the courage to take that step. Each next step from there on was terrifying for me because I was afraid of what I would find, or even worse, what I wouldn‚Äôt find.

Finally, a few days ago, I had a package in the mail with my full operative report and all surgical documentation. I‚Äôm not trained in the medical field, so I googled a lot of terms from the smudgy pages that were barely legible between clearly having been faxed and the terrible handwriting. I just wanted to find something that explained what happened to me. I didn‚Äôt find anything and just felt defeated, like I‚Äôd never know.

Today I was getting ready to file away those documents and decided to look through them once more first. On the operating room nurses‚Äô notes I noticed that one of the medications they listed as administered, Voltaren, was listed as ‚ÄúPR‚Äù under the section for route, while the rest were IV. A quick google search told me that means ‚Äúper rectum‚Äù. I am completely certain that it was put into my vagina due to the location and type of the discharge (or remnants, I guess) I found in my underwear, so I can say with as much certainty as I could hope for in this situation that they unnecessarily went into my underwear instead of administering drugs via IV while I was unconscious and put a rectal suppository in my vagina, then failed to tell me about any of it. I‚Äôll never feel like their actions were justified and I‚Äôll never feel like I was properly cared for, but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything more I can do.

At least now I know what happened. I still feel so completely violated, and so terrified at the thought of ever having surgery again. Still, because I thought I‚Äôd never know after getting these records I‚Äôm just relieved that now I do. At least that‚Äôs something on my side.

To all of you - the community here - I just want to say thank you. Thank you for telling me your stories and medical experience and opinions and helping to give me the push to look into this further. I don‚Äôt know that I would have done any of it without you. I don‚Äôt think any answer here would have made me happy because I‚Äôll never feel like I got justice for this breach of my trust and my body, but it‚Äôs better that I know. I wish I could express what your contributions in this process meant to me, so thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/qmqkhj/update_is_it_normal_to_have_someone_insert_a/,UPDATE - Is it normal to have someone insert a vaginal suppository while a patient is unconscious after surgery and not tell them?,,111,28,0.97,throwaway184256
oyvib2,Periods,1628209319.0,"My sis started her period early this year. It was very surprising to me and my mom bc she‚Äôs so young. She didn‚Äôt even tell us. We just found bloody underwear and sheets in the laundry one day. 
She was trying to ignore it, she thought it would go away. 
And when my mom tried to have ‚Äúthe talk‚Äù with her she refused to listen and kicked her out of the room. 
After a couple times of trying to talk to her she finally got her to use pads. Still she won‚Äôt talk to her about it. 
Once she asked my mom how long having a period will last and when my mom told her ‚Äútil your my age‚Äù my sis started balling. 

But now she‚Äôs getting‚Ä¶very aggressive. 

See today, she went to the bathroom right before I did and I noticed there was a bunch of blood stained paper rolled up  in the toilet and didn‚Äôt really think anything of it. once I was done doing my thang(#1 btw) and flushed the toilet, it erupted and flooded the bathroom floor. 
So my first thought was she probably tried to flush a pad and didn‚Äôt know any better bc she refuses to listen to anyone.  
When I tried asking her about it she starting shutting down like usual. So my mom tried to talk to her while I cleaned the floor. And she told her to shut up, kicked her, and told her to leave her alone. 

My mom and I don‚Äôt know what to do. 
I‚Äôm worried she might‚Äôve been SA or something bc I‚Äôve heard that SA can jump start your hormones and your period and I don‚Äôt know why else she‚Äôd react this way. I‚Äôve never heard of or seen this type of behaviour regarding periods

(Also she does have a history of aggressive behaviour, she was very aggressive/violent once my mom and her dad split when she was 3 and I was 13. But she grew out of it)

mmmstw,WomensHealth,1617868345.0,"(Background: Prior to this I had the exact same copper IUD for 4 years with absolutely no problems).

This all began when I had my old copper IUD replaced with a new one (a 5 year copper IUD) in mid February of this year. The procedure was very simple, the doctor simply pulled the old one out and inserted the new one. There was a little bit of pain but it wasn't too bad and the whole thing took less than 20 minutes. I felt great as I left the clinic as I had such a positive experience with my previous IUD and assumed it would be the same this time.

Unfortunately, things started to take a turn when I had my first period. I knew it was coming as I could feel the cramps starting so I prepared myself for quite a heavy flow (to be expected and completely normal for the first few months after IUD insertion). Because I expected this, I was quite prepared in that I was wearing a GIGANTIC pad and had a spare one in my bag. My period, however, seemed to be quite light. I continued with my day thinking maybe this time around it wouldn't be as heavy as my first IUD. I finished work and was on my way to do an exam, for which I had to travel on public transport for about an hour and a half. First I had to take a bus, then 2 trains. I stood up to get off the bus and that's when I felt it. A sudden GUSH of blood. I panicked but kept walking towards the train, hoping to find a bathroom. There was no bathroom. I looked around and couldn't find anywhere I could go and sort myself out. So I decided to get on the train for the 10 minute journey and hope there would be a bathroom on the other side. There was no bathroom. Again, I reassured myself and decided to just check when I got to the exam centre. As soon as I arrived I ran to the toilet. As I sat down, huge blood clots the size of three fingers came out as well as huge amounts of blood. My underwear and a good part of my jeans were stained red. I changed my pad and ran to 7-eleven to get supplies to clean up. Luckily I was wearing dark blue jeans and a black hoody that covered my bum. In the toilet again, I cleaned up as best I could and had to run to make it in time for my exam. 

Once in my seat for the exam, I felt the gush again, and again and again and again. I knew it had soaked through. I sat as far forward on the edge of my seat as I could so I wouldn't leave a stain on the yellow chair. Next, I had to move to another room (to prepare for the speaking exam) and I tried my best to cover myself as I was led there. In the next room, I did the same thing and tried to sit on the edge of my seat. I knew I had left a small stain and was so horrified. I asked the invigilator if I could go to the toilet and she said I would receive a penalty. I then had to go to ANOTHER room where I had to sit outside on one chair (leaving a stain) then go inside and sit on another chair (leaving another stain). The invigilator who led me there knew rightly what was happening. As I looked her in the eye and asked to go to the toilet again for this emergency, she told me no once again. Then she took a piece of tissue and went to wipe the seats down. The amount of blood that was coming out was more than I have ever experienced. A pad for a very heavy flow lasted about 30 minutes before it was soaked through again. I got through my exam and ran to the toilet again but I had no way of hiding it this time. I tied my hoodie around my waist and took a cab home. In the 40 minutes it took me to get home, I had once again soaked through my jeans and through the thick hoodie. 

Because the blood loss was so much, I was a bit concerned and went back to the clinic to ask if there is any problem. I could only meet with the nurse who told me we should do a blood test to check my iron levels. Then we made an appointment for 3 weeks later to see a doctor and discuss the results. At no point did the nurses explain to me that there was a chance my IUD could have been expelled, nor did they perform a pelvic exam, which I believe is procedure. 

Three weeks later I go to see the doctor, who tells me my blood test is normal and gives me some medicine to control the bleeding for my next period. I leave the room feeling relieved until he suddenly calls me back in and asks if I had a pelvic exam last time to check my IUD is in place. I told him I hadn't, to which he looked surprised. He performed a pelvic exam and said he couldn't see the strings and that I'd need to have an ultrasound. To my horror, the IUD was not seen in the ultrasound and had in fact been expelled. The doctor explained that I could be pregnant and gave me emergency contraception, despite me telling him I have been having regular sex with my partner for the past 3 weeks, unaware that I had no IUD! He told me to come back in 3 more weeks to have a pregnancy test. 

I already knew at this point that, if it did turn out I was pregnant, I am in no position to keep it and would be requesting a termination of the pregnancy. 

A week later I took a home pregnancy test and it came out positive. Distressed and upset, I immediately went back to the clinic to have it confirmed and explain my circumstances. I have had an X-ray and one shot of the Pfizer vaccine in the past month, I was not aware my IUD had been expelled because nobody checked and I am in no state mentally or financially to have a baby. The nurse immediately asked if I wanted to apply for an abortion. Now I have to wait another 2 weeks to see 2 doctors so they can assess my physical and mental health and determine whether I'm fit or suitable for an abortion. The procedure comes at great cost and I am already experiencing pregnancy symptoms, which are impacting my daily life. Needless to say, I feel traumatised by this whole experience and I hope nobody else ever has to go through the same thing. 

I‚Äôd just like to reiterate that I had a 100% positive experience with my first copper IUD and, despite everything, I still think I will go back to it as my contraceptive method. In addition, (though it is not the patients responsibility to remind health workers of this) sometimes people are tired and mistakes like this can happen so if you do go for an IUD check up, make sure it‚Äôs actually in place. 

I have no hard feelings towards the nurses and doctors at the clinic as I know it was not intentional and they are so kind and helpful in every way when I visit. I get the feeling they know they made a mistake and they are now trying to help me as best they can.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/mmmstw/psa_an_iud_horror_story_long/,PSA: An IUD Horror Story (long),,112,33,0.97,larasiowa

i204dx,TwoXSupport,1596317021.0,"I had quite long hair (down to about mid-back) and I got it cut for the first time in ages yesterday. I asked for two inches off to get rid of the split ends, that was it. The hairdresser seemed...I don‚Äôt know, disappointed? Judgmental? So I said that I would be okay with a little bit of layering too, at the ends to make it lighter, since I‚Äôve liked that in the past. Second red flag I should have noticed was when he had me sit for ages with the conditioner on because ‚Äúyou need it.‚Äù Then, we started chatting, and I stopped really paying attention. He seemed like a nice guy. Plus, I have extremely bad vision without my glasses, and I always have to take them off before I have a haircut. I can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs happening as it progresses, so I basically have to trust the hairdresser.

Wrong move. My hair is shorter than my shoulders in the front, and heavily layered, to the point where I can barely put it in a decent-looking ponytail or braid. I hate it so much - every time I move my head I can feel that all the  hair I liked so much is gone. Even in the back it barely falls to my upper back. It frames my face in a way I really don‚Äôt like, since I‚Äôm extremely self-conscious, and it feels like the one thing I liked about myself is gone. The guy seemed so pleased with himself, and how ‚Äúnice‚Äù he made me look. He said he ‚Äúhad‚Äù to cut off more than we agreed because my hair was dry. 

I‚Äôm honestly kind of furious, but mostly at myself. I didn‚Äôt say anything to him - just thanked him, paid, and left. I convinced myself that I liked it, until this morning, when I saw myself in the mirror and cried. This is far from the first time this has happened to me, and I hate it so much. Part of me feels like I should never go to a salon again, and just learn to cut my own hair. Why can‚Äôt people just listen when it comes to something ON YOUR BODY?

So a couple of weeks ago I posted this: https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/8kd0di/recurring_yeast_infection_since_moving_in_with_my/
and you guys were so, so helpful I decided I'd do an update!

I managed to find Fluconazole (an oral treatment) in a pharmacy without needing a prescription (although the first pharmacy I went to asked for a prescription so I got very lucky with the second one!) I took one pill every evening for 7 days, and even by day 2 or 3 it felt much better. 

I was on holidays at the time, but since I've come home I've changed several things; when I have sex, I now pee within a couple of minutes of it being finished (before I was a little lazy and would wait longer) and I clean myself with baby wipes or shower afterward. I also change my underwear twice a day now, and when I shower I use toilet paper to dry there, as opposed to the towel I use for the rest of me. Since I started being more careful by doing these things, no sign of any infection and I feel way healthier down there!

I guess I'm just updating because this taught me a lesson about how important it is to look after your body, especially your vagina!

In middle school and high school I was constantly uncomfortable, embarrassed, and worried it would show through my clothes because it would leak through my pants and look like I peed myself. 

The last few years I've had to wear a thin pad everyday. If I don't, I feel like I peed my pants and by the end of the day, I smell a slight odor. The wetness used to also cause horrible chaffing in my inner thighs. 

I've brought this up to two different gynecologists and they couldn't give me any answers. I've never had a pap smear come back abnormal, and the doctors I asked about it just kind of shrugged and had no clue. I've been tested for everything like STIs and BV, but this started well before I was sexually active.

 It happened before I was on birth control, while I was on various oral pills, and it still happens the same now that I currently have an IUD. Nothing has changed the flow of wetness at all. 

I'd also like to add that when I have sex, it's also super wet. That part I'm not complaining about, but in normal everyday life it's very annoying and embarrassing.

b95o51,Healthyhooha,1554336135.0,"Hello y'all, 

So I am 23 years old and suffer from (or used to? Don't want to jinx myself!) chronic UTIs. They started when I was 19, first became sexually active and typically occurred at least once a month but usually more like 2 or 3. Oh, and on top of all of that, my bladder shrunk; I now have to pee at least every three hours, no matter how much liquid I've had. Lovely stuff!

My doctors and I (gynecologist, urologist, gastroenterologist, and my PCP) spent three years trying to figure out why I was getting recurring UTIs and couldn't go more three hours without peeing. We did ultrasounds, MRIs, XRAYs, probably hundreds of urine tests, and a urethral catheter test (I can't remember the correct term, but they would insert a catheter and take urine directly from my bladder). By all physical evidence other than my UTI pain, I was and am completely healthy! Nothing wrong, no STIs (STDs), no allergies (like latex or something else), no tumors, no kidney stones, nothing. No one could explain why I was getting UTIs so frequently, especially when my symptoms would start, my urine tests indicated a high number of bacteria, I'd go on 5-7 days of antibiotics, and bam. No bacteria at all. Even from the catheter exam. I had a standing prescription for antibiotics because my doctors were all just like ""...IDK. Crap. Sorry.""

But I haven't had a UTI in 6-7 months now! Why? The only thing that has changed is ***I don't sleep with underwear/shorts/sleep pants/etc. on. I sleep naked.*** Literally, this is the only thing that has changed. I got a concerned call from my doctor (whom I'm rather friendly with because of all the time I spent in her office) when I hadn't filled my antibiotic prescription for several weeks. I told her the change I made, and after some silence, she told me that while there's no scientific proof that sleeping without panties helps chronic UTIs, several of her patients have had the same thing happen when they began sleeping naked. 

I'm not a doctor. I'm not even a science major. I'm studying to be a History Teacher. This is only my experience, but I wanted to share because after all those years of pain (which doesn't even compare to others I've heard of) I wish someone had at least suggested sleeping naked to me. It was such an easy fix. Disclaimer: I have had 2 (**TWO**) UTIs since I stared sleeping naked about a year and a half ago. However, if I hadn't have changed my sleeping habits, I have no doubt that that number would be in the double digits instead of a simple, doable TWO. 

I hope this helps someone. No guarantees it'll work, but as I wasn't the only one this has helped, thought I should share!! Have a good (UTI free!) week!

zunrkh,Healthyhooha,1671932075.0,"I'll try to keep this brief. I'm obviously not sponsored or financially motivated to share this, it just helps me so much. 


I have struggled with yeast infections, UTIs, bacterial vaginosis, vulvadinia and vaginismus for almost my entire life, starting at about 6. I'm 20 now. I tried everything, conventional medical treatments, cotton undies, supplements, sleeping commando, being commando constantly, no pants, etc. Nothing worked long-term. I found a lot of relief through my fantastic doctors and overall being careful, but no matter what I did my issues would always come back. Up until recently, I had never experienced sex that was not at least a little bit painful.

I got another UTI, probably my 8th one this year about a month ago, and it was awful. I have been so frustrated, so tired, and so angry for so long, so finally I decided to try something I had considered in the past but never done. I bought a pack of men's cotton boxers.


Now hear me out. I know cotton panties are a big thing, but they still are tight and for me at least agitate me around the seams no matter what type I use. Since switching to 100% cotton boxer briefs from Amazon, I have not had ANY ISSUES. I sleep in them, wear them with normal clothes, etc. If I have to wear tight leggings in a professional environment, I will wear a thong, but I change immediately and I only use unscented baby wash for them when I wash them. Not only are these boxer briefs extremely comfortable, but they wick sweat very quickly, don't cause any agitation, and for the first time in my life I'm not constantly worried whenever I have sex, exercise, or get splashback on the toilet lol. 

Sure they aren't the sexiest thing ever, but frankly, it's a worthy trade in my opinion. Definitely at least worth trying! I wear a women's small and I got a men's xsmall for the boxers, I would say check the size chart because they're a little tight on me but still super comfy! I also cut the legs so they're a little bit shorter and stretched the elastic. I seriously cannot tell you guys how much this has helped! I recommend it 100%! Just make sure they're cotton and not some other type of fabric.

wimlal,Healthyhooha,1659897222.0,"Wasn't sure where to put this, but I hope I can help someone that might have the same issues I did. I had issues with BV and vulvodynia over a 4 or 5 year period and now I'm BV free and pretty much pain free.

I started out with BV in 2017/2018 and I was dismissed by my doctor saying it was a yeast infection and thrush. I tried all the caneston treatments and nothing was working.
I did my own research and realised it was BV because I had the awful smell. It was terrible and after a year I managed to go to a different doctor, they did a test and found it was BV. I took metronidazole which worked, but the BV came back after my next period. I took metronidazole another 2/3 times and the BV always came back after my period. I had had the BV for about 2 years now. 

I then started to have some pain during sex. It was small at first, but just got worse as time went on and my bf and I just stopped having sex as it hurt everytime we tried. I was tested for STIs twice but it all came back negative.

The pain was like a sharp burning intense pain around my entrance at first, especially the lower part. But then my clitoris and lips would hurt too. The entrance was the most painful part and when me, gynecologists or doctors touched it was the worst pain I've felt. I would be on the brink of tears during examinations and I had quite  from a few different gynecologists.

It started out hurting just when it was touched, like during sex, but then would hurt all the time. I was in agony and I was crying all the time and was so stressed about it. I was trying nappy cream to soothe the pain, but nothing worked.
I now know I had provoked vulvodynia at first which then progressed to unprovoked vulvodynia too

I went to doctors and gynecologists in my area and none of them really knew what to do. They gave me amitriptyline on 10mg which did nothing and the pain was reduced once I got to 30mg but it was still uncomfortable. However, 40mg made me feel dizzy and faint, so they swapped me to nortriptyline, but it made no difference to the dizziness and I still had the pain. I really felt like there was never going to be an end to this, it had been about 3 years at this point.

I decided to research vulva pain specialists and vulvodynia specialists. I found a vulval clinic in Durham (NHS County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation trust) and asked my doctor to be referred there. It took a while to get an appointment letter and it was a 4 hour journey from where I live, but I was willing to try absolutely anything at this point.
I saw a doctor at Chester Le Street Community Hospital and he told me to stop the amitriptyline as it won't cure the pain, just masks it. He explained that things like irritants or long term infections can cause vulvodynia, so I assume my BV was the cause, but I also used to use soap to clean my vulva which may have irritated it too, now I just use water.
He said that my nerves were extremely sensitive, so even a slight touch was registered as pain and I needed to desensitize them slowly.

He did an examination and gave me lidocaine 5% and told me to apply it 4 times a day and keep on top of the pain. I did that for 3 months and I couldn't believe that the pain was gone once I applied it. I put it on after I went to the toilet and as long as I kept on top of it the pain was gone. 
He also said to use it before sex, but at that point it had been over a year since my bf and I had had sex and I was scared and didn't want to have sex at all because it had hurt for so long. We did try a couple times but struggled as the provoked pain was kind of slightly inside by the entrance and it was hard to put the lidocaine in that area. I was also extremely tense and not relaxed which also didn't help.

At the next appointment he did an examination again and decided to do a biopsy to check my cells and also remove some scar tissue that was by my entrance which was the part that hurt the most to touch too. He numbed the area with an injection which did hurt, but the biopsy was okay. It was sore afterwards and it did swell quite a lot. I had to be careful how I sat down and walking for a while was uncomfortable. After about 3 weeks it was completely healed though.

The doctor also referred me to the pain management section in North Durham hospital as I was struggling to be in the mood for sex. I never thought about sex and just totally avoided it and everything around it. Even kissing my bf made me anxious as it used to lead to sex even though I knew he never expected anything more. I felt so bad, but I just got so anxious and nervous.

The doctor also gave me some dialators to help desensitize the inner area that still hurt a bit. He said to use it with the lidocaine and I was able to comfortably use the 2nd one and sometimes the 3rd, but only slowly. It was the moving and friction that often hurt not really the stretching. I used lots of lube too. The Yes Gel moisturiser is the BEST for lube. Doesn't dry out like others do.

When I went to the appointment for pain management at University Hospital North Durham I talked with a team of 3 female doctors and they were amazing. I felt so comfortable and they were so helpful. They told me to take everything off the table with my bf and just start so small. To be very clear that we need to be slow and nothing leads to another thing. This was all stuff my bf already knew and did, but just talking about it made me feel better and more relaxed.

I also told the group of doctors about my issues with recurring BV. They said that the metronidazole wipes out all the bacteria, so I need to make sure good bacteria is there too. I had used balance activ before alone and it didn't work to cure BV, but they said it's a preventative. They said to take metronidazole again and use balance activ bv treatment pessaries (get them for like ¬£9 in asda) after it for a week (I did 2 weeks to be safe). I then used balance activ again for a week after I finished my period. I did that for the next 3 periods and it never came back!! (Touch wood) I occasionally use them maybe for one night after a period or if I notice an odd smell, just to be safe.
I also drank a glass of cranberry juice a day and still do just to help. I really think this made a difference too.

From what the team of doctors said the way I was using the dialators was in a clinical kind of way too. I was just doing it to desensitize and massage the pain away, not to feel good. The doctors said I need to use them in a more pleasurable way and to relax and enjoy it.

I had slowly used the lidocaine less and less. I used the YES moisturiser alongside it as I was quite dry. I also came off the pill due to emotional issues too, but I don't think it was linked to any of this. 

I also changed my mindset and used the dialators one night. I dimmed the lights, put on nice music and totally relaxed. and idk why but I decided to not use any lidocaine and it didn't hurt! I honestly could not believe it. I'm not sure if the doctor just managed to remove the painful skin when he did the biopsy and that combined with the regular usage of the lidocaine, but it didn't hurt! I was so happy I could have cried.
It took a while before I was ready with my bf, I was also super nervous still. He had been so amazing and supportive during all this. I am super lucky to have him.
It's been a year since then and we have sex more often now and I'm in the mood way more. There are still times of discomfort, but I don't freak out, I just try to relax and change positions. I sometimes use the lidocaine after my period as it's a bit sore after then, but only occasionally. My bf and I also communicate regularly about sex which really helps.

I honestly can't thank the doctors at durham hospital enough, they helped me so much and were amazing. Sorry this was so long, but I really hope that me telling all this can help other people who are going through the same thing. Feel free to ask me any questions about any of this :).

So I was in Costco, doing Costco stuff, you know how it is. At the end of a shockingly inexpensive trip I needed the bathroom and trotted off to do so. There was a sign that said ‚ÄòMale attendant cleaning‚Äô on the wall of the entrance to the female washroom. Now. I did a cartoon sliding stop mentally. A lot of things went through my mind: I need to pee!!! I‚Äôve been raped by a man. I work in Health Care just enter that frame of mind of ‚Äòit needs to be done‚Äô. Covid really has changed a lot of stuff. Are they legally allowed to do this? Do I feel safe? I NEED to pee. 
So I went in. I trust Costco, at least the ones in my city. They‚Äôve handled Covid well, they treat me, a paying customer professionally. I asked the male attendant if I was still allowed to use the bathroom. The man immediately made eye contact, had a pleasant face, smiled and said something along the lines of ‚Äòyou saw the sign on the door? Sorry! Because of Covid and short staffing we‚Äôre legally required to clean each hour with the possibility of a wrong gendered attendant OR shut down the washroom while it‚Äôs cleaned.‚Äô I said I understood and went to use a stall away from him. He spoke up right away and said ‚Äòthat one doesn‚Äôt lock‚Äô I cannot express how much I appreciated him being upfront about that. It was already an awkward situation. I‚Äôm going to be exposed with a man in the room. He WILL hear me pee. Having a door that locks was kind of important! He saved me the anxiety packed decision of walking out the stall to another one with him watching KNOWING why I left or the feeling of staying in a stall that didn‚Äôt lock with a man in the room. I did my business and he kindly made lots of noise with his cart. Once I was out I (that felt important too) started the conversation again with ‚ÄòCovid sure has changed stuff!‚Äô He apologised again and reiterated they had to choose between shutting down the bathroom or letting women choose if they were comfortable with a man in the room. 

Ladies. How does this strike you? It‚Äôs been on my mind ever since. Obviously some women wouldn‚Äôt be okay with this at all. I found myself asking myself ‚Äòwhat if your trauma was still very fresh? What if you hadn‚Äôt seen the sign and walked around the corner with no warning? What if?‚Äô 

All in all I was very impressed with how Costco had handled it. They clearly had chosen a very kind professional man to do it, had coached him on what to say and how to interact with the women.

OK, hear me out.

Sounds crazy, but since the beginning of August I have been having crazy issues I have never had before with recurrent BV and YI.

I was tested for all STI- negative. The doctors took samples, and on two separate occasions about 3 weeks apart confirmed BV and yeast.

I was doing everything. No over the counter yeast medication was working. I took about 15 Diflucans throughout all of this, 7 in a row.

I used boric acid for almost a month.

Then magically, two days after running out of my toilet paper, that I got at the end of July, a week or so before my symptoms started, the pain started going away.

All the burning, and itching, painful urination finally going away.

WTF.

He also has a psychological block as well, which he think is caused by the condom. So the last time we had sex, he brought up the idea of going on birth control so we could do it without a condom. I've never had sex without a condom with any of my partners. I've been on birth control before and I had SEVERE reactions to it, even when I tried different pills. Depression, extreme rage, mood swings, thoughts of suicide, and apathy. I'm not particularly open to an IUD because I have no medical reason to get one. I've been doing just fine with condoms for the past few years; I've never had one break on me or had any pregnancy scares.

azfoxo,Healthyhooha,1552224901.0,"Hi folks,

I've noticed that there's semi-regular posts on here with people struggling with shaving. I have just recently struck upon something which works well for me after a long time of experimenting (and suffering!) This post will be split up into parts, so if you want to skip ahead to the last section, do so.

****

##Backstory/history

I have very sensitive skin and fine hair. I also have mild pili multigemini. My skin is *very* prone to outbreaks and especially folliculitis, especially downstairs leaving me unable to shave without being punished for it. Often, I find that each shave progressively worsens my razor burn and folliculitis to the point that it becomes untenable to continue shaving.

And anyway, horrible razor burn and folliculitis is not a nice aesthetic so I always feel better off trimmed than looking like a plucked hedgehog, and about as angry too. This left me with trimming as my option given the circumstances. This works and avoids most of the problems I have with shaving, or at the least ameliorates them but it isn't ideal for me.

****

##What has worked, what hasn't


Here are some things which I have tried with shaving and my experiences:

###Pre-shave

* Hot water/steam

This absolutely works to soften the hairs. I wouldn't go without it.

* Shaving cream

This works well and I have found a body wash which makes a good lather and I tend to use it with shaving. You can buy a special shaving cream bowl and brush cheaply online if you want to do this. Or if your skin is fine with shaving cream in a can or special shaving soap then go with that. Though if your skin is prone to allergic reactions, in my opinion you're better off avoiding the fragrances and accelerants etc. in commercial shaving cream. Lathered soap/body wash seems to help me.

* Shave oil

This is something which is marketed towards men and beard-care, from what I can gather, but it is exceptionally good at reducing friction and razor burn. Where I live they market tiny little 1oz bottles for stupid prices ($8 or $15, I can't remember but it's ridiculous) and the main ingredient is sunflower oil or safflower oil with some fragrances and dyes. Guess what works just as well? Sunflower oil for the kitchen. It's the exact same stuff, except without any potential irritants. You could also use coconut oil. I would *not* shave without oil on my skin these days, even if I'm not using soap I cannot skip the oil.

###Shaving

I always shave with the grain (along the hair grown direction) as I find going across or against causes too much irritation.

The fewer passes I do, the better. One is ideal for my skin, although that's not necessarily ideal for removing hair properly. I try to minimize how many passes I do and I judge it by how irritated my skin is feeling.

###Post-shave

* Exfoliating

It does little beforehand and afterwards causes increased inflammation which worsens everything. I do not use it in my aftercare routine because my skin is just too sensitive and it makes everything that much worse.

* Witch hazel

Has had minor/no positive effect, post-shave. Apparently distilled witch hazel is has none of the astringent properties that the extract has. It's likely only as useful as an alcohol-based after shave product. I no longer use this.

* Deodorant

I see this recommended often. My skin is too sensitive to handle fragrances after shaving. I've never tried it because my skin *barely* handles deodorant under my armpits so I don't trust that it would be any better on inflamed skin. The key ingredient in deodorant that makes it work for shaving happens to be alum, which you can get your hands on in a pure form easily, and it happens to be known as...

* Alum (bar or powder)

I used to apply an alum bar (it also comes by the name of crystal deodorant) on damp skin after shaving. This absolutely works wonders to reduce irritation and bleeding from any nicks. These days I get alum powder from my Indian grocer (known as *fatakdi*) and I have a small bottle filled with a strong solution of dissolved powder in water which I apply because rubbing an alum block was causing irritation due to the mechanics of it. The solution seems to get more alum on my skin quicker and easier than using a block does too. I *always* end my shaving routine with alum solution, and if I don't I will end up with folliculitis and general irritation, even just from trimming.

* Moisturizer

It works. Use your preference, try for fragrance free if you are very sensitive. Apply after alum. It seems to help.

* Loose clothes afterwards

Definitely helps.

##How I have suddenly managed to start ""shaving"" again

This is the juicy part. I recently decided to try a double edge razor (I've dabbled before.) I recently took the plunge and purchased an adjustable razor which has a function that allows you to control how ""aggressive"" (read: close) the shave is. I picked up a Chinese knock-off of a reputable brand which has settings from 1-6 for about $10, with the legit model selling for around $100(!)

I set it up as I do and put it on its least aggressive setting and went to work with the included razor blade. I typically get a feeling of irritation and swelling as I'm shaving which is a sign of razor burn and ingrowns and folliculitis on their way. I was surprised to find that I didn't get this with. 

I went along the grain as per usual and did my usual aftercare routine. I found that it went very well for my skin and I noticed that my ""shave"" wasn't really exactly what I'd call a shave but more like a very close trim with about a mm of hair left above the surface of the skin. This is why my skin wasn't getting irritated. I found I didn't need to be extra-cautious as I usually am with overlapping or repeated passes, which was an immense relief for me.

I found that the included blades are actually pretty bad, not awful but not good enough to want to use them. I'm going to throw them away or use them for projects because they are crap (replacement blades are extremely cheap anyway.) I think that with decent quality razor blades which I prefer, the shaving will go even better and I'm planning to try out going against the grain next time too.

I might even explore going for a more ""aggressive"" setting to see how that works for me. As it stood I had to choose between horribly inflamed, irritated skin or grappling with crappy electric trimmers which never worked very well for me and which took much longer than they should. But now with this new approach I have a very simple, quick way of getting a close trim without upsetting my skin and it's already a game-changer for me.

****

&nbsp;

I hope that this effortpost is helpful to those people out there who really struggle with shaving like I do. If you're at your wit's end and you are looking for something which is quick, cheap, and easy then I'd recommend giving an adjustable double edge shaver a try. If it worked for me with skin as sensitive as mine then there's a good chance that it will work for you too. It might not be a smooth-as-silk outcome but I think it's going to be the best compromise I'll ever get with my skin.

I'm happy to answer questions about all of this if anyone is interested!

****

**Edit:** I swapped out the razor blade for a preferred type and, maybe a little foolishly, adjusted the shaver from 6 to 5 (making it a closer shave) while following my typical routine. My expectations were set from the first shot and I accidentally nicked my skin a couple of times because I was being careless. I also experienced some mild razor burn after the fact, though it settled quickly enough (~24 hours and things were near enough to being back to normal.) This time around it was much less forgiving than the first time.

I think that the least aggressive setting is the one for me, though I might try adjusting it by about 0.5 above the least aggressive setting in future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/azfoxo/my_modest_shaving_success_story/,My (modest) shaving success story,,109,4,0.99,Randolf_Schnitzler

IUDs can be a fabulous solution to all of your birth control needs (though, like any medical procedure or medication, they don't work for everyone). They can be quick and painless to be placed and give you up to 10 years of protection depending on which device you choose.

If/when you get your first IUD or when you get an IUD removed or replaced, talk to your provider when you book your appointment (many times, speaking directly with the provider is necessary) about how you expect to be treated (like a human who can feel pain) and confirm that they will have lidocaine gel available to apply to your cervix at the very beginning of the appointment followed by a paracervical block injection before insertion or removal/replacement is attempted. I recommend calling the day before your appointment to confirm these details and also considering confirming this plan before putting your feet in the stirrups to ensure everyone is on the same page.

td2ngi,Healthyhooha,1647160831.0,"I had my second bartholin cyst last week. The last time I had it, it only lasted 2 1/2 days and then popped. This time it grew faster and the pain was worse, don‚Äôt know why. I had it for three days and after doing some online research I found tons of home remedies and tips for pain management. I read about women who had these cyst from 2 weeks to years‚Ä¶YEARS! Now I will admit I have an incredibly low tolerance for pain, I‚Äôm as modern as they come when it comes to medicine and even more liberal when it comes to medications but the thought of spreading my legs for some random ER doc freaked me out more. We‚Äôll blame it on being a teen girl with self esteem issues. 

I gave those remedies a try for two days before I had my sibling drive me to the ER in tears at 2am (mind you at this point I couldn‚Äôt sit, walk, or sleep). The doctor immediately knew what it was and had everything laid out before I even got undressed. She gave me a local anesthetic directly into the cyst‚Ä¶you can imagine how that went. After that she made a small cut with a scalpel and drained it and I felt like I was in heaven. After that she did something called ‚Äúpacking‚Äù, which is where they put a small piece of gauze into the cavity to help it drain and make sure it doesn‚Äôt heal over too quickly. 

Now for the next part, I don‚Äôt know wether to give credit to the actions of this Doctor because she was a woman or because she was a WOC but she believed my pain. Something I‚Äôve never experienced. And allowed me to get a three day prescription for pain meds and a note to excuse me from work/school for two days. 

After two days I went to my GP and I got the gauze removed, it was basically painless and I‚Äôve been healing nicely ever since. 

Now I know going to the hospital isn‚Äôt accessible for all people for many reasons but for those who are able please do, especially if the pain is so bad you can‚Äôt move or do daily activities.

q4bu29,Healthyhooha,1633744253.0,"Hi there,

I‚Äôve been wanting to post about my YI healing journey for a long time now, but wanted to make sure I have absolutely no YI symptoms anymore before posting.

**Backstory**

I strongly believe my YI stemmed from my boyfriend (partner) and I using saliva as lube for sex, we‚Äôve used it before, but in limited amounts, but towards Oct/Nov 2020, it became our main lube substitute (ladies, **please don‚Äôt use saliva for sex**). Come mid-Nov 2020, I get my first ever YI.

I use the OTC YI medication, Monistat (7 day cream version), and feel like it‚Äôs quite a bit better, so my partner and I return to our normal endeavours a few days after (unprotected, which is usually not how it goes, we usually always use condoms). A few days after, my YI comes back full swing, so I use PH boric acid suppositories and use for 5 days. I believe it started getting better, but wanted to go to Dr to make sure - tested negative for yeast. However a few days after, it came back again.

I go on a **strict candida diet** (no sugar, no carbs) because I‚Äôm set to tackle this.

This time I used Monistat again, and though it worked, my YI came back after unprotected sex again. Dr prescribes me Terconazole, which is a strong cream anti-fungal, as well as using boric acid suppositories for 18 days, and it worked, until unprotected sex happened and my YI came back (you‚Äôre likely sensing a pattern, I didn‚Äôt fully comprehend until this time).

At this point, my vag is **extremely irritated, dry and I felt like there was no hope.**

At wit‚Äôs end, I use Terconazole again but this time for 13 days rather than the usual 7, used one suppository of vaginal probiotics (which dried my vag but maybe helped?), abstained from sex and OH MY GOSH my YI didn‚Äôt come back.

**The Healing Journey Begins**

Due to the amount of chemicals I put my vag through, it was quite irritated. I recall there were days I had trouble sleeping because my internal vagina (near cervix) felt super dry. I‚Äôd still get slight ‚Äúpings‚Äù of itchiness, but the infection didnt come back (still gone to this date!).

I stuck with the candida diet, until March where I verrrryyy slowly re-introduced sugary and carb foods (still minimal compared to how much I‚Äôd eat before). Extremely slowly re-introduced intercourse around July (4 months after my last infection, it was that irritated).

**Discovered Other Problems**

Though my YI was gone, I noticed I kept getting urinary frequency (tested for UTI but was negative), paper-tissue-like watery discharge, and my vagina was still sensitive and irritated. I posted on this sub-Reddit and people kept mentioning to get tested for Ureaplasma.

I tested positive for **Ureaplasma**.

Why was this discovery important? Ureaplasma is often an underlying cause for recurrent common infections for women, including UTI, BV, YI and Trich. I recall three years ago I kept getting UTI-like symptoms but no positive test results, it eventually went away until recently.**I suddenly understood why I likely kept getting the UTI symptoms and recurrent YI!**

**Where am I now?**

I have ordered both my partner and I the MicroGenDx complete for women and men, the urinary frequency comes and goes so we‚Äôve been procratinating on sending our tests in (we‚Äôre in Canada), would have to ship to Texas.

Thankfully no YI recurring and sex life is back to normal with no vaginal irritating - also attributed to protected sex with pH balanced vagisil wash beforehand and pH balanced lube.

**TLDR**;

Got recurrent YI likely from saliva used as lube for sex (don‚Äôt ever do that). Successfully treated with 13 days Doctor prescribed Terconazole, candida diet and abstaining from sex. Vag was super irritated the next few months. Discovered UTI like symptoms (not UTI) and YI recurrence likely stemmed from Ureaplasma which I tested positive for. Currently going to get tested with BF with MicroGen DX complete test kit (urine and vaginal / semen). YI free to this date!

Truly hope this helps, please message me or comment (preferred) if you have more Qs. I wasn‚Äôt able to find a full YI healing journey anywhere - everything was essentially ‚Äúused boric acid, and it worked‚Äù when boric acid didn‚Äôt work for me. EITHER WAY, THERE‚ÄôS STILL HOPE.

**Edit**: it was Terconazole cream my Dr prescribed, got it confused with Fluconazole, which is usually a anti-fungal pill.

At the time, I didn‚Äôt know my blood glucose was creeping toward 400, so while I had an abundance of testosterone because of this, my estrogen was way too low in relation. So, while I still had the urge to screw like a minx, I had no moisture.
Skip forward several months - my blood glucose is under tight control (runs around 90-110) and my hormone levels are back in regular balance throughout the month. Now my cycle is regular, too, and my horniness/wetness issues have resolved. If anyone else is going through something like this I urge you to get your hormone levels checked. No one suspected I was diabetic because I was 95 pounds when I was diagnosed, and my unchecked blood glucose wreaked havoc on my body before it was discovered. Several months after my T2 diagnosis I‚Äôm still getting back to ‚Äònormal‚Äô.
Stay healthy ladies‚úåüèª

Edit: I just wanted to add - fifteen years ago I accepted that my hormonal imbalance was ‚Äònormal‚Äô as my gyn told me. My estrogen levels were sky high and my testosterone was on the very high end of normal.
The thing is - hormonal imbalances are never normal. There is almost always an underlying condition, and it isn‚Äôt always diabetes. I encourage every woman to get their hormone levels checked regularly and if they are out of whack - pursue it! Find out why they are out of whack. Because the issue hardly ever resolves itself, and there is usually a lot of silent damage being done that will eventually manifest.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/of6wq2/follow_up_about_sudden_vaginal_dryness/,Follow up about sudden vaginal dryness,,110,8,0.98,None

I think this study on [vaginal flexibility](https://www.longdom.org/open-access/measurement-of-vaginal-flexibility-and-its-involvement-in-the-sexual-health-of-women-2167-0420-1000302.pdf) is so interesting and wanted to share!

Basically they were bringing up that although the vagina is super stretchy, it obviously still has limits. Out of 120 women, the limit where penetration became uncomfortable was between 3.9 to 6.3"" (+0.2 to 2.2"" more than resting length). Based on that they said a lot of women have issues with partner incompatibility. They didn't really talk about how arousal would factor in to that though.

The only study I could find measuring changes with arousal is from the 60s. They found on average out of 100 women arousal causes the vagina to lengthen around \~1-1.6"" (without any penetration).

To stick those two studies together, comfortable penetration for the average person with a vagina could be roughly between 5 to 8"". Wish there were actual studies on this though, I can't find any.

I don't think it matters for most people, and even if it does it's easily managed by either getting more turned on, limiting depth or improving flexibility. But just thought it was super interesting, and something that hardly gets talked about.

What do people think? Anyone read any other sciencey sources for this?

I'm a rape survivor and thankfully have processed most of that and am doing much better now, but still regularly get accosted by men in ways that make me feel really unsafe.

I recently had a very scary and upsetting experience where this really gross and creepy guy essentially lured/tricked me into meeting him in public, then made it so that it was really difficult/awkward for me to leave. It took me 4 hours of sitting there staring at his ugly face while he tried and failed to """"flirt"""" with me, said awful uneducated things about marginalized groups, and referred to me sitting there awkwardly and uncomfortable as him being on a ""date"" with me, which actually still makes me want to vomit just thinking about it because it was just so delusional, I would literally never go on a date with someone so disgusting like that. I finally said I had to go when I felt like I'd been sitting there long enough and when I looked at my phone and saw that I'd been sitting there for 4 whole hours just putting up with this nightmare, I felt actually horrified. And I hate that I feel like this happened because for a split second, I wasn't actively being on the lookout for danger.

And even though this is one of the ""more awful"" experiences I've had lately, it's far from an isolated experience. In the past couple years alone, I've had a guy who worked at a store that I went into physically corner me to ask me out on a date, I've had guys loudly scream at me/catcall me from passing cars while I walked alone, I've had guys try to stalk me, and so many other experiences. Sometimes they're vulgar and loud, but more often than not they do it all """"politely"""" because of course they don't want to feel like a creep even when they are one.

And when this happens, some part of me always blames myself. Because I feel like it's on me to prevent these things from happening because no one else will. No one gives a fuck about protecting women from being harassed. No one stops it. So I have to be the one to stop it. And I'm just so fucking exhausted. Like I decided after this most recent experience with that creep that I'm going to work harder on not feeling like I have to be ""polite"" all the time, even when someone is ""politely"" making me uncomfortable, and to be able to just put myself first and extract myself from these situations, even if it feels uncomfortable/awkward in the moment.

See, on Monday I will have no more maxi pads and will have to just rely on normal pads, which worries me as I can barely get through a hour right now on normal pads.

My school is a very period unfriendly place, they do offer pads, but it‚Äôs flimsy low-flo pads that aren‚Äôt really of use to anyone.

Then all the boys thought it would be hilarious to ask to go to the toilet, so that the teacher would get frustrated and but a ban on people going to the bathroom. That way she couldn‚Äôt go. She did eventually manage by telling the teacher of the situation. Still, pretty humiliating for her.

My tale of woe starts like this: A couple weeks ago I had sex and I guess the condom my partner used was pre-lubricated, unbeknownst to me. I had started my period around that time, so I didn‚Äôt notice until a few days later an unpleasant fishy odor down there‚Ä¶ I hoped it was maybe just a weird period smell and took a treatment for a yeast infection, figuring that would cure it. BOY, it did not. I had sex again a few days after my period ended and lemme tell ya, I did not realize things were as bad as they were until then. That intro line from the song ‚ÄúColt 45‚Äù about the fish market? Yeahhhh‚Ä¶ thankfully my partner has anosmia (can‚Äôt smell super well) from long Covid, but I was humiliated enough to go to an urgent care. I tested positive for BV, and started Flagyl. The next day, I started getting telltale symptoms of a UTI and I headed back to urgent care to treat that. I finished out both courses and although the UTI got taken care of, I still had the odor and weird discharge, so I tried another antibiotic. Still had odor, still had weird discharge. I‚Äôd been having issues for almost two and 1/2 weeks at this point so I found this sub for advice. One post was someone asking about a retained tampon, which picqued my interest because that was something I was worried about too- when I had sex, I didn‚Äôt remember taking out my tampon before, but I wasn‚Äôt entirely sober and after reading most of the responses and performing a self-sweep I figured there was no way I had retained a tampon. Many of the comments on that post said that OP would know if there was a tampon up there. Well, I‚Äôm on week three of BV that just won‚Äôt go away and started my period again. I went to the bathroom bc shark week always brings gastrointestinal problems for me. I was doing my thing when I suddenly felt something slide out of me, and lo and behold, the world‚Äôs most decayed tampon was sitting there. IDK HOW I missed it while I was trying to find it but to everyone who said you can‚Äôt lose a tampon- you ABSOLUTELY can. I tried ‚Äúbearing down‚Äù multiple times, did a very thorough sweeping of my vagina, and even had sex MULTIPLE TIMES without realizing that I had a retained tampon.

Thought it was a yeast infection because I was the tiniest bit itchy, had brownish/pinkish discharge and it smelled BAD. I used a yeast infection treatment from the pharmacy yesterday. I called the nurse‚Äôs hotline and she recommended I go to urgent care. Any suggestions?

UPDATE FOR ANYONE INTERESTED:
I went to urgent care and had a pelvic exam done.

She pressed down on my stomach and I didn‚Äôt exactly feel pain but it felt unnecessarily tender so that‚Äôs another reason why she sent me to ER.

I spent 3 hours in the ER. I had an ultrasound (outside and intravenously) and then I also had to use a speculum to get a culture swab. Last, they decided to put a super painful shot in my butt cheek and give me a prescription for antibiotics because the doctor feared not noticing something and me one day realizing I can‚Äôt have kids because she missed something.

When I was 17 (and very anorexic) I developed strong pain in the area right under my rib cage, in solar plexus. It feels like an infected wound, in the sense that it hurts and I get dizzy and nauseous if I touch it, but if left alone it's managable. Sometimes it's almost not noticable, sometimes it's so painful that I have to pay attention to breathing carefully cause a deep breath will hurt. (That's how it is right now.)

I was first told it was the anorexia, but I sorted that out, I'm healthy now, BMI 18 and eating alright, but it's still there. I was told acid-reflux but I'm on meds for that and it doesn't help. (The dose I take is twice what someone my size would need too.) I was checked for ulcers and when it wasn't that they said it's psychosomatic (I have PTSD) but I KNOW that's wrong, I know what psochosomatic pain feels like for me and this is not it. Also it doesn't correlate with my mental state at all. I was also told to work on my self esteem cause that's supposed to be good for the chakra that's there or whatever. 

It tends to become worse from coke, tea, and other acidic things, but it can also show up if I completely avoid those, sometimes eating makes it worse, sometimes it makes it better. Being cold always makes it worse. Obviously, this shit makes it hard to concentrate, exercise, enjoy sex, and enjoy food since I always worry it's something I eat.

xwlsvr,WomensHealth,1665002687.0,"Going to try to be brief. We recently moved and my daughter saw a new doctor today for her annual well visit.

My daughter got her period when she was 11 and has suffered from extremely heavy, 10+ day periods. Last year, after she had established her cycle for 3 years, her previous doctor agreed to put her on birth control.

I thought of this as a win-win. It will help her periods out, and when she does need it for contraception, she‚Äôll already be on it, and hopefully won‚Äôt get pregnant at 16 like I did.

The doctor today asked if she ever tried coming off her birth control. Then proceeded to tell us there are negative long term effects. And that she should try coming off of it, and then get back on only when she plans to use it for contraception.

Here‚Äôs my thing though. What teenage girl, in the heat of the moment, is going to be like wait I need to be on my birth control for 3 months before we can start having sex?

Another comment that put me off was the fact that she said she has stayed the same height for a few years but is gaining weight, and asked if anyone in our family had thyroid problems.

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶My daughter is 5‚Äô1 and 129 pounds.

What the actual fuck?
I‚Äôve already made up my mind that we aren‚Äôt seeing that doctor again.
